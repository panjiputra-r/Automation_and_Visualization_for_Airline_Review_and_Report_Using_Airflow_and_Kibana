5,Adria Airways,1.0,"""Had very bad experience""",2019-09-17,True,  Had very bad experience with rerouted and cancelled flights last weekend with Adria airways. Original Route was Ljubljana to Sarajevo return. Two weeks before i received an email that the flight was cancelled. Offered route change was Ljubljana to Sarajevo via Munich. Flight back changed to Sarajevo-Pristina-Ljubljana. I accepted. The first flight via Munich was ok. Two hours before the return flight I got the email that the flight was cancelled. I had to rebook via hotline and had to accept a flight with Croatian to Zagreb. I reached Ljubljana 4 h later and had to organize Transport from Zagreb to Ljubljana on my own cost. Do not book flights with Adria airways.

7,Adria Airways,1.0,"""book another company""",2019-08-24,False,"  First of all, I am not complaining about a specific flight. I am a Lufthansa frequent Flyer and I normally fly the route Munich - Timisoara. This summer season Lufthansa offered the flights on this route to Adria Airways, as they are a star alliance member. I can only tell that I have the worst experiences with them. In over 90% of the cases they are late, they don't fly on time. Always they offer the same excuse: they have no slot free. This is an unacceptable excuse, as all other companies flying on similar coridors seem not to have this problem. In addition, as LH Cityline was operating these flights I have almost never heard this excuse, or had this problem. I am flying on this route for 6 years already. They started also to cancel some flights. Maybe combine 2 flights into 1 to spare some money, who knows. The cabin crew is decent - not wow, not bad - but there also also situations when the staff are really rude and not customer oriented. I would recommend anyone to fly with this company.

The seat was quite comfortable although the cabin looked a bit nagged. Despite the fact that this was a regional flight, Adria Airways offered a Wifi service with good connection, an IFE system and free chat function amongst the passengers.

Flight outbound and inbound were ok and although departing slightly late, we arrived pretty close to scheduled time, outbound landing in Ljubljana was a bit rough. The staff were all pleasant enough and served complementary water, a small selection of other food and drink were for sale but some advertised items were not available. Seating is now a bit cramped with even less leg room than Easyjet, I am just 6' and my kness were toching the seat in front and were crushed further by the person in front moving and the person behind digging their knees into my back as thay wer oviosly struggling for room too.

Proceeded to the Aegean Airlines check-in area which was manned by helpful staff and carried out self check-in. Met by polite staff at bag drop. Queues were starting to form at some counters, the one next to me was being held up by some irritating passengers who were questioning the baggage allowance for hand luggage. The Aegean website clearly states the weight permitted as do the various signs at check-in, yet some people pay no attention to this and continue to be rude and aggressive to check-in staff who are only doing their job, politely and professionally.

160,Aegean Airlines,7.0,"""Service was good and attentive as always with this airline""",2022-06-20,True,"  Early morning flight due to flight schedule changes (three months in advance notice). Flight JMK-ATH left early and arrived nearly 20 minutes ahead of schedule in Athens. Despite a nearly 2 hour connection, one of our priority tagged bags did not make it (together with 30 other bags) on the flight from ATH to CPH. It is quite impressive that Gold Air handling missed a whole trolley of bags. Flight to CPH was fine. Good service and quite nice new seats in Business Class (empty middle seat). Breakfast OK, not fantastic. Service was good and attentive as always with this airline. Bag trouble took 1 hour to register in CPH. Friendly service but took a while. One of our bags arrived on the wrong bag belt after us asking where it was. The other bag was left in Athens. Bag arrived following day late at night on a strange bag delivery service as I had to come down to the delivery truck and visually point at my bag. Strange and not very professional. Bottom line, poor to lose a priority bag in a two hour connection. And, by the way, I do not like the way this airline randomly pick on economy people to weigh their bags. In my opinion is either all or none. Not some poor people who has to face a huge cost because of one kg overweight hand luggage. What is really the point of upsetting people. The airline should know that if they write max 5kg hand luggage people will bring 10, if they write 8, they will bring 12.

Agent did this and explained the process in excellent English. I paid the extra and booking was complete, no fuss, no bother. Flight was outstanding from start to finish, as usual.

Hand luggage was checked to ensure compliance with Aegean 's terms and conditions which it did. Breezed through Passport control despite the terminal being quite busy. Ample and polite staff kept queues short. Aegean Airlines terminal was spotlessly clean with ample duty free shopping available. Amazing authentic Greek food products like Greek baklava, feta and extra virgin olive oils were on promotion. Had to buy some. Boarding was orderly and we were greeted at aircraft door by immaculately dressed cabin crew. I am always impressed by how professional Aegean Airlines cabin crew are. They put Turkish Airlines crews to shame. On time departure with on board service of drinks and meal again served in a very professional and polite manner with a smile.

173,Aegean Airlines,1.0,"""it is clear that they are in a steep decline""",2022-04-01,True," Both me and my wife are frequent business travelers and Gold Miles & Bonus members. Aegean Airlines started off as a promising, refreshing presence in the Greek market but it is clear that they are in a steep decline. We've experienced such poor customer service in the last several years on a number of occasions. Refunds that took 18 months and countless calls and e-mails to process (for flights that Aegean Airlines canceled). Missed connections due to flight delays where they failed to assist us to reach our destination or arrange overnight accommodation for us. We were asked to cover the expenses on our own and then submit the receipts to receive compensation. We've taken trips where we were asked to pay service fees to change Comfort Flex and Business Class tickets. These two categories are their most unrestrictive fares and allow same day changes without a penalty, yet on a number of occasions, when their website failed to successfully change our tickets, we were asked to pay a service fee to proceed with the change. I could go on and on with a number of other disappointing practices but all in all, it seems that they've adopted policies and restrictions that we only find present with the so called low-cost carriers. All while charging full service carrier regular fares. Until they re-adjust their policies to a more customer service oriented level, we will certainly avoid flying with them in the future.

Planes are new with USB charging on board and if you are lucky, a basic on-board wi-fi streaming service. Food quality is really bad, a tiny cold sandwich, served in a very environmentally-unfriendly card box. Drinks choice is OK. The part that lets this airline down is cleanliness.

I was 3 hours early for my flight from Dublin to New York. I needed help at the Dublin airport. I asked 5 different Aer Lingus staff for help and was told 5 different answers. I even spoke to a supervisor who was the worst of all the staff. In the end I missed my flight and had to reschedule. For Dublin to be the home hub for this airline they were the worst people to deal with. The hub in New York at JFK airport was must nicer and professional. The WIFI did not work in the plane and only half of the screens worked. The plane staff even made an announcement about the screens freezing up while watching a movie.

Things went rapidly downhill after that, and Aer Lingus complete lack of regard for paying customers became all to apparent. Our luggage went missing and Aer Lingus have been rude and unhelpful. As a customer I am so disappointed in the customer service provided by my national airline. As an Irish person I'm ashamed and embarrassed to think that other people may be subjected to this treatment. This is not the image I want my national airline to be portraying of Ireland and Irish people. We have a short six day holiday in San Diego; Day 1 is now gone because of Aer Lingus complete and total lack of regard and concern for paying customers.

211,Aer Lingus,7.0,"""would certainly use them again""",2023-06-14,True," Our outbound flight was excellent with no issues and on 10 June for our return flight, I have one big issue and some niggles. For the whole flight, the cabin crew locked off one of the two available toilets. There was nothing wrong with it as the cabin and flight crew used it. Keeping a toilet exclusively for crew use is, in my view, unacceptable. The seat on the A330 is comfortable and I had the best 4 hours of continuous sleep I have ever had in the air. The food offering was, for me, poor except for the snack just after take off with the first drink service. It comprised a pack of five mini, savoury biscuits and a little tub of onion chutney to dip, both of which were delicious and very different from the nuts or pretzels others offer. On the outbound flight, we were offered the traditional juice or champagne prior to take off but no attempt was made to offer this on the inbound flight. The Asian-style beef at dinner had little of the Orient about it. I didn't try the dessert or either of the starters. IFE was available but very limited choice compared to many other carriers. Finally the complimentary wi-fi was somehow not available on this leg but you could pay. Outbound no problem a voucher was given shortly after boarding. Okay, quite a bit of whinging there, and apart from the very comfortable seat the only other positive was that despite delayed take off on both legs the plane arrive on time or a little early.

212,Aer Lingus,2.0,"""Never again will I fly Aer Lingus""",2023-06-14,True,"  We booked a ten-day tour of Ireland thru Trafalgar Tours. The tour started 19 May 2023. We wanted to arrive early and see some of Dublin before the tour started so we booked an Aer Lingus flight from Orlando Florida to Dublin on the 17th of May. Our flight was due to depart at 8:30 PM and arrive in Dublin at 9:30 AM on the 18th of May. (Aer Lingus Flt. 120). We were told that the incoming equipment had been delayed and that we would depart at 9:30 PM. The incoming aircraft arrived shortly after 9 PM followed by a fire truck! We were told we would depart at 10;30 then, 11:30. this went on till 2 AM on the 18th. They said the flight was canceled, but we would be boarded in the morning as soon as the aircraft was repaired. Imagine 300 people scrambling to get their checked luggage and make their way to the check in desk to get a hotel voucher (we found out that they booked the hotel rooms at 9:00 PM that night), madness. We got to the hotel at 4:30 AM. We had three hours sleep and returned to the airport to see if our plane had been repaired, it hadn't. we were told we would be boarding Aer Lingus flight 34 for Manchester, England at 5:45 PM. We arrived in Manchester at 7:20 AM on the 19th of May. Our connecting flight (Aer Lingus 3327) to Dublin did not leave till 5:45 PM that night. We arrived in Dublin at 6:40 PM. We arrived 33 hours late. We had paid for a hotel room in Dublin for the night of the 18 that we didn't get to use, and we missed the complete first day of our tour. We filed a claim with Aer Lingus for $ 600 each for me and my wife per EU rules. We also asked for $220 for the hotel room we had paid for, $174 for meals and $800 for the first day of the tour that we missed out on. They have offered us $147 in total compensation although they are responsible for our losses. Never again will I fly Aer Lingus or say a good word about them.

221,Aer Lingus,1.0,"""our luggage has not been located""",2023-05-23,False," There are lots of choices when booking a flight. We happened to be celebrating a milestone wedding anniversary and booked a trip to Italy. The flight itself was fine. We arrived at the airport in Naples and were the only passengers on a flight of 300+ people to be standing at the baggage carousel when it shut down because all the bags had been picked up by the passengers except for us. Our bags were missing. So now we head over to the missing baggage window and fill out a missing baggage claim form. This is Sunday morning. We make our way to the hotel with the clothes on our back for a week long stay to celebrate our anniversary not sure where our luggage is. We are tired. We have been on two flights for 10 hours. We wake up the next morning and put on the same clothes we arrived in to get breakfast. Never mind that there are new outfits in our luggage that we purchased for this trip that are floating around somewhere. After calling Aer Lingus multiple times and being told our luggage is out for delivery, we logged on to their missing baggage website only to learn our luggage has not been located yet in spite of Aer Lingus agents lying and telling us on the phone our bags were on the way. Was this so we wouldn’t go out and purchase necessary items to change into to keep Aer Lingus lost baggage costs lower. We are now in our 3rd full day in Italy and Aer Lingus still stands by their claim that one bag is out for delivery, when the truth of the matter is they can’t specify where it is en route. This saga will probably continue for us long after we depart Italy in two days. To add insult to injury, Aer Lingus cannot tell us what is acceptable and necessary that we can purchase while we wait hopelessly for our luggage. Talk about being given the run around, reading from a computer screen that the bags are in route, escalating our calls to supervisors who only read the same script on a screen. My Advice to Everyone out there - DO NOT BOOK YOUR FLIGHT through Aer Lingus if you value the peace of mind that you are entrusting a company that values it’s customers and will make a sincere effort to correct an error in a timely and honest manner. Let’s face it, a lot of people are like us, we don’t travel all the time, we spent thousands of hard earned dollars, and to be in Europe for going on four days in the same skivvies we arrived in should not be tolerated by customers - so book with another airlines if you value peace of mind.",A330,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Naples via Dublin,3.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,no,May,2023
225,Aer Lingus,3.0,"""I felt like I was in economy""",2023-05-17,True," Never again. Paid megabucks for business class. No welcome on board drinks, e.g. champagne, orange etc offered. No drinks trolley coming round offering drinks throughout the flight, the only drink I was offered was with my meal. No duty free offered. No food came around until about one hour into the flight, it seemed as though they heated one meal at a time. Slow is an understatement. On our outward flight, of the 30 seats in business class, there were only 13 seats occupied, yet I still could not have the meal I wanted as they had run out? Food was bland and uninteresting. The staff seemed to be just doing as little as possible, not interested, not friendly at all to anyone really. Got a code for free wifi in Business Class, it did not work, so no free wifi. At JFK when we were boarding our flight, which was delayed by an hour and forty minutes, a ground crew member attempted to open the barrier to allow economy class ticket holders with buggy/prams to board before anyone else did, until another staff member told her that business class passengers should be boarding first. Apart from the roomy and comfortable seat, I felt like I was in economy.

Be aware: you can do nothing online, including book or change seats and must call Customer Service for everything. They do not respond to emails, customer service is outsourced to overseas Indian or Eastern European countries where some do not speak English well enough to answer your query. They always say you have to email but you never receive a response (this after 24 emails over 3 mths and no responses). We flew business and they ran out of food. They offered economy meals. Flight attendants clearly did not like their jobs. The food (when you did manage to get any) was horrible and it was next to impossible to get a second drink, even water. Finally, we arrived in SFO to hear my husband's name called - they put my bag on the flight from Dublin but not his. We were leaving and checked through from Paris. They promised it would arrive next day, next flight. 10 days later it is still listed as tracking and in Dublin. We phoned several times to be told it was still in Dublin as far as they could see. We went several times to the airport and checked Lost Luggage -also finally went a 3rd day to see the same flight coming in and found a helpful man on security who phoned around. He left to go to an 'office' and came out with our bag. Fully tagged. It is still listed as 'being tracked'. We have contacted Aer Lingus to advise this but still listed as being in Dublin. .

251,Aer Lingus,3.0,"""cabin crew are just awful""",2022-11-13,False,"  Having had our fight cancelled from Shannon on the 19th Nov 2022, we flew from Dublin the following day. Aer Lingus were very good about the cancellation and looked after us well though communication was not great following the cancelled flight. The cabin crew served the most awful food I have ever had on a flight. The chicken meal I asked for was only lukewarm and since I didn't want to risk being ill on my holiday I decided not to eat it. Later they served coffee, I asked a cabin crew member for sugar and he completely ignored me, I assumed he didn't hear me and repeated my request, he immediately said I am dealing with something in a rude and aggressive manner, I was so embarrassed, even the people sitting next to me remarked on him. We flew back to Ireland on the 28th October on the 18.55 flight. We got a cereal bar and orange juice for breakfast, my husband asked for coffee following breakfast and was told that the captain said coffee was not to be served due to turbulence! We were certainly not advised about turbulence. We will never fly Aer Lingus again if we can possibly avoid it. Terrible.

BOS-SNN-LHR June 15 22 Returning from Paris CDG-DUB-BOS on June 28 22. The outward flights were uneventful. usual 30min delay in Boston, poor quality food in coach. I liked the new A321NEO to Shannon much more comfortable than the old 757. However the return was hell. We arrived at the counter at CDG to total chaos after waiting in line for an hour we got to to an agent a contractor (Swissport?) she told us we didn't have a reservation so I gave her our number she then said the BOS flight is cancelled. But I pointed out that the previous customer is on the same flight and they got passes for both flights. She then said our reservations were cancelled by Aer Lingus and we would have to make our own arrangements to get home. I asked for the duty Manager who told me the same thing and suggested I call customer service. I made her call customer service and she got us on a BA to LHR and AA to BOS the next day. But No hotel or meals. I had to find a hotel on my own using a tablet on airport wifi. When we got back I submitted a claim for EU261 Compensation with Aer Lingus on July 1 Ref #8333779. I got an Ack for this the next day and have heard nothing since although I have inquired of status several times by Email. eventually I got thru to someone who said they are still working on the issue and to expect to hear soon - this was on Sept 30-still waiting. I have a Vacation home in Kirush Clare Ireland So i guess I will be using Delta or Icelandair in future. In conclusion you have to be crazy to fly this airline.

271,Aer Lingus,4.0,"""leaving their customers hungry""",2022-09-12,True,"  The service on my flights from Washington to Dublin, and back to Washington from Dublin, was minimal. There was one full drink service meal at the beginning of both flights, but only a small snack later. There was no second drink service at all on the flight to Dublin, and only a coffee and tea service on the flight to Washington. The lack of a second drink service was especially bad on the flight to Dublin, since there was a long line at Immigration and I couldn't get my morning caffeine fix until after I claimed my bag and was in the public area of the airport. Aer Lingus is a little bit cheaper than other airlines, but it's still not that cheap - for paying more than $600 roundtrip, I expect that they can offer some coffee and tea or another soda before landing. I think Aer Lingus needs to decide if they want to be a low cost carrier where nothing is free but everything is available for a price, or a full service carrier with commensurate service.

302,Aeroflot Russian Airlines,5.0,"""felt very rushed and unpolished""",2022-01-30,True,"  Aeroflot has set high standards of achieving a 5-star airline status and my expectations significantly increased as a result. Positives included a seamless upgrade from Comfort to Business at LHR, good Plaza Premium lounge, very good miles earning vs redeeming ratio. The A350 hard product is phenomenal, especially on a short London route, and the catering on this flight exceeded the expectations (usually poor hot meal, however, the 4 cheese pappardelle was very good). However, there are two drawbacks on Aeroflot. Firstly, I  dislike Aeroflot’s or SVO’s standard practice of parking planes at the literally remotest ramps possible in -6C and with ice covering the stairs. I understand there maybe logistics issues, but doing so to a premium-heavy flight like London and for their most luxurious widebody is just beyond logic. I am observing that the crew service on the A350 / B777 is poorer than on their other planes. It gave me a feeling that the crew were very much undertrained; as a result the service, although efficient, felt very rushed and unpolished.  I still believe that the Aeroflot Business Class is above any of its European counterparts from the overall package size view, and if one manages to upgrade for miles (amazing redemption value) like I often do, then this product is possibly the best business class. However, full-fare paying passengers might be disappointed, because, in addition to a cutting-edge hard product, for such money, you expect a hospitable and personalised staff service beyond the ‘just tick’ attitude.  Overall, is Aeroflot a good airline, yes. Is Aeroflot a 5-star level airline and is its business class worth paying a full fare, no.",A350-900,Solo Leisure,Business Class,London to Moscow,5.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,no,January,2022

Drawbacks: B777-300ER in need of refurbishment (hopefully this is coming soon), very hard, wobbly, uncomfortable seats resulting in back pain, unaffordable internet, new terminal severely overcrowded (even worse than in the older Terminal D).

Requested/demanded to meet supervisor, was told by staff that they were in another building! Finally get into the terminal and then spend next 10 hours at another information desk in the terminal. With 3 kids this was absolutely one of the worst travel experiences, especially since I paid for business class to have the comfort. They finally put us up in one of the worst hotel rooms imaginable (available only at 10pm), with no ability to upgrade (since we were not in the ‘Russian section’ of the hotel). We were finally able to get out of Moscow the following day, 24hrs later. No response from Aeroflot customer service. Don’t expect one. Don’t think they care either.

The onboard entertainment was non-existent and no one was watching any of the few movies offered. It gets even worse: the meal service was the worst I've ever had in business or first class on any airline. It came not on a plate but in an aluminium foil-wrapped tin container and was inedible.

They were essentially no frills and provided the mere basics on a flight.

For a three hour flight, only a snack mix packet was served. Check in is very fast, boarding passes printed almost immediately, but the lines are long and people seem to turn up very late for their flights often, which means a lot of queue cutting. Boarding is mostly a mess, but bearable. Compared to LATAM’s lines though, Aerolíneas’ lines are relatively short. The 737MAX I flew was amazing. The engines were extremely quiet and the windows were large and gave a great view. The seat is the same as China Airlines. Legroom reasonable for short flights. One thing I am critical about, is that overhead bin space is very scarce. People sometimes have to store stuff 3-5 rows in front or behind them.

The following day I flew to PVR in economy class because business class was full. Arrived in PVR but my luggage did not. It arrived 2 days later. My review is not about the delays but the bad service of Aeromexico crew and ground service. Aeromexico flight attendants are cut and dry sort of unfriendly. They are not rude but they seem that they are not happy doing what they do. During the flight, some of the pursers talk too much. I like to have 1J seat and I constantly hear they chit chatting among themselves. Another annoying factor is that as a typical Mexican Airline, they love sponsors.  Ground personal, are the worst. They seem all so unhappy that I try to do my check in at home and not face them. Watch out, if you have a problem, then you are in trouble. Seldom they find solutions but try to make it more difficult for you.  If you are going to connect in Mexico City Airport, do yourself a favor, choose the fastest connecting flight, I think it is one of the worst airports I have been and don´t rely on Aeromexico Lounge. It is a lounge for anyone that pays a fee to get in. It is uncomfortable, crowed, noise and there is seldom any food to eat. If you are a frequent flyer with AM, you probably already realized that their mileage programe is a hoax.

The unfortunate result is that our IFE screen were not functioning. I asked the flight attendants to fix it and they claimed to restart but didn’t. I had to ask 3 times and they started to ignore me. Unbelievable lack of customer service. The customer service email address is a joke too. I notified them of my experience and they offered to provide a voucher for the equivalent amount for the upgrade, but didn’t provide one after asking 2 times.

Due to a flight delay I had an unplanned layover of 16 hours at the Mexico City Airport. The airline doesn't offer any compensation. It doesn't have any customer service. The price I paid for a hotel stay completely negated the savings of buying a cheap plane ticket. I think they should tell people that sleeping on an airport bench is part of the travel package and your airline itinerary is just a rough guide.

The biggest positive is the seat is quite comfortable, and that's important. The negatives include an absolute horror show at Mexico City Airport T2 (and an even worse transit to T1). Nothing is particularly easy or smooth and Aeromexico does little to nothing to help ease transiting passengers through the madness. The lounges are third rate and overcrowded. As a result ended up finding a few cafes in the terminal which were far superior than the lounges. The really surprising negative were the Aeromexico business class cabin crews. While efficient in serving meals and performing basic tasks, not one crew had warm, friendly people that either welcomed you or smiled. They come across as some combination of angry and arrogant. It's surprising to me because it's not reflective of Mexico itself, which has some of the warmest, kindest people on earth. Not sure where they find these crews or how they train them but they don't do a particularly good job.",Boeing 787-9,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Sao Paulo to Mexico City,4.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,no,November,2022

When we finally got out of the plane at 17:43 we raced to our connecting flight which is supposed to depart 18:05. We got there at 17:55 and were denied boarding. They sent us to customer service that got us on the next flight at 23:55. We paid for upgraded seats because I’m a tall guy and we did not get them on the later flight due to availability. When we called the airline customer service for a refund for the upgrades they told us to contact the customer service email and promptly hung up on us. We called back and spoke with another representative and she informed us we would indeed have to email customer service. We did email them, but got a prompt email back basically telling us there is nothing they can do refund us. Now that I’ve read reviews for this airline I see it’s a common problem.

Literally took hours to rebook as they’re unfamiliar with Aeromexico booking policy. At Mexico city, had to to wait another 13 hours for connection. Made us pick up our checked luggage, then refused drop off because departure flight was more than 6 hours away. Food was also terrible. Economy food might have been better.

602,Aeromexico,1.0,"""The staff were unhelpful and rude""",2022-03-14,True," This was the worst airline experience I have ever had. On our flight from Chicago to Mexico City our bags were forcibly checked for being the “last to check in” even though we checked in via their app at 6am Thursday for a 12:30am Friday flight and then checked in again upon arrival at the airport at 7pm. This was the first flight to be delayed, the staff at the gate and flight attendants were beyond rude and unhelpful, and the plane ride itself was horrendous. Our flight home from Cancun to Mexico City was delayed for over an hour and we were not informed of this delay until we were supposed to be boarding, we still do not know why the plane was delayed. We had a connecting flight to make in Mexico City which we made them aware of and they promised 3 times that we would make it, Mexico City would hold the plane for us. We were told we would touch down in Mexico City at 6pm, instead we touched down at 6.37. Our connecting flight left at 6.50. We ran across the airport only to miss our connecting flight and play the game of how are we getting home. It was a struggle to find anyone in the airport in uniform who spoke enough English to understand us. Person after person just told us, we don’t speak English, sorry we can’t help you. We finally get someone to help us book a new flight that was 15 hours later. Aeromexico gave us vouchers for a hotel, transportation, and some food. Very generous, thank you. We get to the hotel they put us in to find out the hotel was booked up completely and we were going to have to wait 30 minutes to then be shuttled another 20 to a new hotel. By this time it was 12.30 in the morning and we had to be up again at 5 just to head back for our new flight. It was such a frustrating travel day. Our new flight starts boarding on time at 9am, we are so excited to be leaving and leaving on time until we sit on the plane fully boarded for 40 minutes before we even take off. Again, the flight was delayed. Out of 4 flights in total that we took on this one trip, 3 flights were delayed for at least 40 minutes. I do not recommend flying with Aeromexico and I especially do not recommend flying with them when you have a connecting flight. Your odds of making it are slim. The staff were unhelpful and rude and if at all possible I would rate my experience with them a 0/10.

There was no personal inflight entertainment system on board. The plane looked the older fleet. Cabin Crew was quite friendly. But the food was the typical. I expected Kazakhstan cuisine on board. Beef was not served on Board. And now the Transit part. Astana airport was of good size and very well maintained. But the problem is that the airport doesn't provide drinking water to the departure and transfer passengers and people have no choice but to buy drinking water (1 euro for 500 ml).

Almaty to Delhi flight was late due to transfer passengers. But it was not a problem because the duration was not much. The problem The cabin crew looked exhausted for no reason. The food served on the flight was only a light breakfast (omelette and a small piece of potato cutlet) which is not sufficient for a 2 hour+ flight. A complete meal should have been served.

883,Air Astana,1.0,Air Astana customer review,2018-08-08,True,"  Moscow to Delhi via Almaty. Moscow to Almaty on a new Boeing 767, with personal entertainment screens and mood lighting. Staff accommodating and professional. The meal was delicious with metal cutlery. Wine and beer were complimentary (no spirits on the menu, though), and extras were served with no frowns. IFE was one of the best I experienced, no lag whatsoever. One weird thing was that the screen by design could not be adjusted when the seat in front was reclined, so the viewing angles could be uncomfortable. We were given outstanding amenity kits with neck air pillow, slippers, pen, some hand cream, eye shades and ear plugs. Different coloured kits seemed to have slightly different content, so make sure to collect them all. The crew passed the cabin with drinks several times after the meal service. Seat comfort was okay, nothing outstanding. Almaty to Delhi was on an older A321, with no personal screens. The seats were very comfortable with great seat pitch and traditional ""thick"" profile of the seats. Cabin crew were lovely and the meal was even better. There were some amenity kits given as well, except a bit smaller ones (which makes sense on a 3 hour daytime flight). You could access their entertainment via your own device and onboard wi-fi for free with no issues, and the selection was impressive, but the lack of power ports meant you will run out of power quite soon. Delhi to Almaty was practically the same as the flight from Almaty to Delhi. For Almaty - Moscow I have made a bet to upgrade on their website (the lowest amount possible), and we were upgraded to business. The flight on a Boeing 767 was wonderful with lie-flat seats, lots of privacy and space, great IFE and pleasant cabin. The cabin crew were very accommodating, greeting us with champagne as a pre-departure drink, and the purser greeted us by name, making sure we had a fantastic flight. Meals were delicious, each course was brought separately. If I could think of any improvement in business class, it would be alcohol menu, because there were just one type of champagne, one type of white and red wine (plus lots of spirits and cocktails). I believe the wine card can and should be improved. Their Bloody Mary was perfect, by the way. Almaty airport is an absolute disaster - it's small, crowded, with nowhere to sit or relax, no decent cafes, everyone is shouting at everyone. Even in business class lounge there is nothing to eat or drink for free, which is just a disgrace. Our luggage made it, and the flights were on time, though. To conclude, I recommend Air Astana, and the economy experience is outstanding, but I will try to fly via Astana next time, since Almaty airport is just so awful.",Boeing 767 / A321,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Moscow to Delhi via Almaty,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes,June,2018

Boeing 787-8 was booked, but A330 I was in. Headache during the flight , and asked for pills from the attendant but it was ignored.

935,Air Austral,1.0,"""This airline is shambolic""",2018-04-03,True,"  This airline is shambolic. Our direct flight from Paris to Dzaoudzi was cancelled and another given after 3hours but via Reunion. On arrival in Reunion, shoved in my face a letter of apology. Agents very stand offish. Nothing offered, not even water. Crying babies, elderly customers not taken care of. Just herded like cattle to a small gate area. On embarking from Reunion to Dzaoudzi our baggage could be seen on tarmac but not loaded. Advised Purser and Captain but they shrugged shoulders. On arrival in RUN, a total of 8 hours late with no luggage. On return flight to Paris CDG we were advised maybe a stop in East Africa, then told once on plane, going direct. Served a freezing cold salad as an entree and thats all. A dry baby croissant for breakfast, but were made to feel grateful. We pay for service and products but must be grateful for something! I contacted Air Austral under EU LAW 261/2004 for my refund as laid out under EU Legislation & after 17 emails ignoring me, I contacted a third party attorney. Sure enough they are paying up my refund. I can only say, this airline is awful. They hold you to ransom after you pay your hard earned money, treat you like you are doing them a favour, glare at you when questioned, ignore the law they are contractually bound to, serve you cold salad for dinner, lose your luggage, contact you after 6 months once summoned by a lawyer, tell you where they are taking you with no chance to deplane if you need to change your plan. The situation is their Boeing 787 has many technical problems, the Boeing 777 is too big to land in Mayotte, so instead of being truthful, they just lie.

I travel very frequently for business and pleasure to Europe and this is by far the worst airline service I experienced within the past 10-15 years. The aircraft servicing flight from Chicago to Berlin was very old, seats did not recline, majority of TV screens did not work, despite the crews effort to reboot the audio system. Normally, obstacles like this wouldn't impact me, but traveling with kids makes a big difference (try to explain to your child he won't be able to recline the seat or use TV on 9 hrs flight). Lastly, and most importantly, Air Berlin lost our luggage. There were about 30 + other passengers flying on the same flight who reported missing luggage. It is been a week and we did not hear back from the airline. We sent about 11 emails to different departments with copies of claim, lost baggage tags, etc. No response. Furthermore, none of the telephone numbers provided on the website are working numbers.

My worst experience with an airline so far. 3 weeks before departure, they changed dates and hours - technically I could choose to get my money back, but buying from another company with such short notice would have been much more expensive - what I paid for was Bucharest to Miami with one stop, what I got was the same with 3 stops - what I paid for was Miami to Bucharest with one stop, what I got was the same with 2 stops. I had to book a hotel room for one night in Berlin because the flights were not in the same day after the change they made (still waiting for a refund), and they failed to deliver the luggage in Miami. It arrived after 2 days - out of 4 Air Berlin flights, 3 were delayed by approx 1 hour each. AirBerlin call-center is bad. They say on the web-site is 24h, but that's not true. If you call them when they don't work, they don't say come back at operating hours.

1050,Air Berlin,8.0,"""the airline looks better""",2017-02-23,False,"  Berlin Tegel to Bucharest. I would start my review with the regret that Air Berlin has stopped flying to Bucharest and those were one of the last flights operated by them. I know it is tough to keep pace with Ryanair but since Air Berlin has moved towards a quality service experience for its customers, maybe it would have been nice to get this experience on this route too. I must say that since I fly Air Berlin (and that is a lot of time) I only had once or twice that my flight was delayed. And those flights to/from Bucharest were both ahead of schedule. I have read it is not always the case but from my experience and point of view, I was really impressed to see so many flights on time. The aircrafts they are flying are new (I suppose the kept only the new ones in their fleet after the restructuring last year) and as a topbonus platinum I always get a seat with extra leg-room which makes flying with them a joyful experience. There are some things that are disturbing: the inflight entertainment system only shows ads of Air Berlin and their partners together with their destinations, over and over again. This becomes too much after some time and they never change. They have an App which you can use on your own device for WiFi and entertainment, but for my surprise you had to pay for watching TV-Series as well, not only for using the WiFi. They are many airlines which offer this service for free. Another thing that I find not right are the prices for the in-flight snacks and drinks. I understand that this is a new market strategy (is it really part of that high quality experience they are talking about?) but there are operators offering decent prices, not 3,5€ for a mineral water. And the coffee was really bad: a bag exactly like tea infused in hot water. I would expect more quality from their famous ""signature"" coffee. I think things are changing and the airline looks better like it used to be some years ago. The cabin crew members are more friendly but there is still much to do. Many people say it has the corporation mentality and they attention for client is low and that is partially true. I think being closer to the client in any way will make this airline better.",A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Berlin to Bucharest,5.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,yes,February,2017

Really like the AB business product a lot more: 19 C seats only, proper lie flat seats and certainly not with cheap air cushions, no cheap trolleys coming down the aisle but proper restaurant style service with excellent foods and wines, very helpful, friendly and professional crews etc.. Last but not least, it usually only takes me about 10 minutes from the door of the plane to the taxi stand at JFK Terminal 8 wheras it can easily take 2 hours at the other terminals, specifically at the International Terminal 4.

I fly them a lot inside Europe and the service is really depending on who is in the crew. It can be a delightful experience or it could be a disaster, although I must say that in the last year you can feel some change inside the management and the service is improving and becoming good, therefore I trust them and give them 10 points for the change they are developing. Some might say that paying for the snacks and drinks it is a downside but I do think that for flights shorter then 2h you really don't need all these. The prices they offer are OK and the quality of the products has improved. You still get the chocolate heart when exiting the aircraft. The planes they got after the restructuring are in very good shape. Not mentioning that the flights are almost all the time landing on time or even before schedule. It is still very difficult to use their website in order to buy tickets and this needs improvement. The mobile apps are sometimes too long under maintenance and you cannot use all the features, but at least people are well informed about it.

I was expecting more from their ""Sansibar"" exclusive menu and the portions could have been more generous and served more often for an almost 12h flight.

Chief Purser later told me that ""there are bunch of things that we didn't get today"" which means that us, the passengers, won't have those. Dinner service was a bit shambolic with the cabin crew in business class seeming uncoordinated and disjointed. My main course arrived barely warm, so I asked that it be heated up again. It returned quite some time later dried out. It certainly wasn't a meal I'd have expected in a premium cabin on a major carrier. What I have learned about this particular route is that the back of the business cabin is preferred by some customers who have their adult children sitting in the next cabin back (Premium Economy) such that the adult child can frequently come up to the business cabin to check on their elderly parent. I met a Premium Economy passenger in the second J class galley who said he booked his elderly parent's seat that way in order to be able to check on them during the flight. What this means for other passengers is a constant flow of people coming from Premium Economy to check on ""mummy"" up in business class. It makes the cabin feel busy and noisy and one has to endure great long chats between adult child and hard-of-hearing mummy about how to maneuver mommy's seat, etc. I have about eight such passengers around me and feel like I'm in a flying nursing home.",Boeing 787-9,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Montreal to Delhi,3.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,yes,July,2023

At this point the captain announced that we're having trouble with the air conditioning, and the plane would be rebooted again. After an hour or so on the plane, we were told we need to get off, but not go too far away, since they need to reset the AC and can't do it with us on the plane, and it'll take about 30 minutes.

Surprised, we then reconfirmed with the other lady crew if our flight was indeed cancelled. The lady told us it wasn’t our flight that was cancelled but the flight next to ours which was AC792. The crew didn’t apologize for the error, instead they took our carry on luggage against our own will saying they didn’t have enough space. I told the guy if I could get something inside my carry on and he refused! My husband told him I needed to take this one important item inside and he snapped back along with the lady crew and said: “If you don’t comply, you can take the other flight which was already cancelled!” Their rudeness continued on as they speak with other passengers in line.

I flew out from Toronto (YYZ) to Fort Lauderdale (FLL) on June 22, 2022, Flight 1628. To begin with, as sprawling as Pearson Airport is the signage is lacking and honestly not clear at all, so it was extremely confusing to figure out exactly where we needed to go just to check in for our specific flight. Air Canada's ground customer service was painfully slow and inefficient - I get there are staffing shortages with the pandemic aftermath, but this was a little excessive. Our flight boarded a few minutes behind schedule which wasn't the end of the world, but we were scheduled to take off at 4.45pm and did not take off until almost 7.00pm! All of us literally sat on the tarmac going nowhere for over 2 hours! The cabin crew was essentially clueless and the pilot kept giving one excuse after another for the delay which didn't even make sense. Every passenger was pretty agitated about the situation, to say the least...we finally took off way behind schedule and did not make it into Fort Lauderdale until almost 10.00pm (original landing time was 7.45pm). The flight itself was OK. At least on AC Rouge, I found the legroom to be mediocre, and the seating marginally comfortable. Flight attendants were generally polite, but not necessarily friendly. Overall, this is my second experience flying Air Canada. My first time was in 2015 going to/from Montreal and I also dealt with poor customer service then, so I should have learned my lesson, but I hope this cautions other potential fliers to avoid Air Canada if at all possible - especially if your travel plans are not flexible or if you need to catch a connecting flight!",A321,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Toronto to Fort Lauderdale,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,no,June,2022

1290,Air Canada rouge,9.0,"""I was pleasantly surprised""",2020-02-17,False,"  I was a bit wary about flying Air Canada Rouge. Numerous comments and reviews and without question the majority of those comments / reviews were negative. I flew from my home in Kelowna (central B.C.) to Edmonton then to Toronto on an A321. I was pleasantly surprised by this aircraft, spotlessly clean and the seating (I was in regular economy for this part of my trip ) was spacious and comfortable. The cabin crew were delightful, quite young and very friendly and efficient, service was very good. The next part of my trip was Toronto to Glasgow, an evening flight on an older Boeing 767, I was in premium economy. There was a separate cabin for premium economy, I had two large seats to myself. The food was excellent, a lovely meal served with a nice imported red wine, service was top class, well done ladies! On these older 767's there is no in flight entertainment, that is simply an issue that you should be aware of prior to booking. I knew that so I downloaded a couple of good movies from Netflix to my tablet and I had a good pair of comfortable headphones. I sat back and enjoyed the flight, had a couple of nice highballs and then a couple of hours nap before landing in Glasgow. All in all an enjoyable experience flights were right on time, if there was anything negative it was landing in Glasgow at 6.30 in the morning. My return flight was Glasgow to Heathrow then on to Vancouver in premium economy again top notch. I'm away again this September to Glasgow, my travel agent found me a very good fare with Air Canada in premium economy.",Boeing 767 /  777 ,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Kelowna to Glasgow via Toronto,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,yes,September,2019

On the return YYZ/MAN Premium breakfast is a slice of banana bread with a drink. Same aircraft both ways and the iPads were grubby, the seat trays dirty. I find the premium rouge seats uncomfortable when compared with Air Canada premium economy. Also, if you use the Rouge iPads, entertainment is only films, no music, games or moving map.

It is impossible to make use of IFE system and I recommend a good pair of noise cancelling headphones. Cabin crew speaks poor English but are nice and let me change seats to the emergency seats without having to pay extra. (I am 192 cm tall so very worth while.) Lounge staff in Beijing were OK but one woman went out of her way to change our seats in the lounge making sure that we got better seats and even bumped us up to emergency row also on the second leg of our trip. Very appreciated. I have never had any issues flying with Air China but I know that Chinese ground services customer service can be very inadequate and unhelpful so happy I have not had to deal with that.

1413,Air China,8.0,"""Service was smooth""",2019-11-20,True," I had serious concerns about this airline before taking my trip, but ended up having a very good experience. So I promised myself I will write a review about it. Best value for money: what caused me to book was the offer of flying a flat bed C-class seat from JFK to Shanghai for $2,200 (return tkt), only with a quick stopover of 90 minutes in PEK. Pre-flight concerns: - I kept receiving automated emails from the airline that my itinerary has changed and that I should contact them and I can change/get a refund for my tkt. The small change that happened once was a 5 minute change in departure time which increased my layover in PEK (good thing, since you need those 90 minute to transfer) - customer service: it's impossible to reach them by phone, the line is not manned. So I emailed them. They responded within 24hrs (or so) and said that my flight's transfer time in PEK is too short and my tkt needs to be changed. But when I went online I saw that my same exact flight itinerary was still being sold on various websites, incl. airchina.us. - The inconsistent response from their customer service really got me worried about the reliability of this airline, so I did some more research online on helpful reviews. I mostly read terrible reviews on how delayed the flights were, people missing their connections and being treated very poorly. That's when I got really worried about having booked this ticket, but figured I will take the risk. Also TPG wrote a fairly good review on them, so that felt comforting. Flight: - Outbound: upper deck of Boeing 747, half empty cabin. Seat was perfectly comfortable (flat bed). Service was smooth, food was good/fine - meat a bit chewy. Staff are friendly and helpful, though be aware they only speak limited english. - Inbound: Boeing 777-300 - full cabin. Seat perfectly comfortable (flat bed). Service was great, they accommodated my specific food requests despite not having ordered in advance. Overall a great flying experience. - All flights were pretty much on time - In-flight entertainment is ok, limited movies selection / limited music selection - no WIFI. Transfers in PEK: - 90 minutes is definitely needed if transferring. You need to take a quick 'airtrain' trip from domestic to intl., even if you don't change Terminals. The connecting flight to and from SHA was a tarmac parked aircraft with bus transfers, so that added time as well. I was traveling with filming equipment and I've never had to spend that much time at security, unpacking my entire bag with all the equipment and letting it run several times through the x-ray.","Boeing 747-8, Boeing 777-300,",Business,Business Class,New York JFK to Shanghai via Beijing ,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,yes,November,2019

The ground experience at NRT was excellent. Quick check-in, security and passport controls, great ANA lounge, priority boarding for Star Alliance gold members. Greetings while boarding was not particularly friendly and so was the service also on the flight to PVG. The food was more than ok for this 2h30 flight. The real odyssee began at Shanghai airport... There was no visible sign for international transfers so I asked my way and was told to go first to the fingerprints collection and then to the regular immigration line. When it was my turn, the customs officer told me to fill in a blue form (for long layover without visa!). After a while there were more and more people to Paris asked to do so. But then someone told us that it's not necessary and we were asked to follow her up to the (well hidden) international transfer counter where we waited about 20-30 minutes. We were around 25 passengers to Paris waiting there until someone came to exchange our boarding passes against new ones (why?). Then all of us had to go back to the immigration counters to get their boarding passes stamped.,  before going back to the international transfer counter again for our boarding passes and passports getting checked once again. After that we still had to go through the long lines of security control. The whole procedure took over 2 hours ! There should have been trained Air China staff to help customers and the airport staff should known the process of international to international transfers and give the right information. If you book international to international you should count on 3 hours transit to be on the safe side. Our aircraft to Paris was on an apron position and we had to take a crowded bus: chaotic to board a large plane with only one stairway. FA were not particularly friendly but the service was quick and OK for a budget airline. The seats were also OK and the entertainment sytem also. We arrived slightly delayed in Paris. I wrote them a friendly e-mail to complain about the disastrous transfer in PVG and I received a short answer: 3 lines in very poor english. Not really giving the impression they care about frequent flyers and Star Alliance gold members. The ticket was cheap and for a very cheap price I would fly them again but only for a direct flight to China, not with an international transfer.

Tickets not booked on their website: not able to choose seats or special meals. I contacted the airline per e-mail and I could order one special meal. I checked in the day before departure to be sure we sit together. Seating was 3-3-3 on the B777 if I'm right: better than the 3-4-3 on some airlines. Check-in opened around 3 hours before departure: the economy class line was very long. I'm Star Alliance Gold member and I could use the business class: pretty fast and checkin staff in Paris very friendly. But the seats I had checked in for the day before were not available anymore and I ended up on a middle seat. Boarding began 30 minutes later but we arrived on time at Beijing airport.  I was positively surprised about the service onboard. Well, it's just a short version of the service of Lufthansa, Turkish or ANA and they don't come as often with drinks during and after the service; you get plastic cutlery,... but it's OK for the price! The food was not a highlight but not bad. The flight attendants mostly friendly with a good understanding of english. They are quick to serve but don't expect too much interaction like you have with ANA or Lufthansa... They are here to serve not to answer questions. Inflight entertainment a bit old, not very responding, froze and had to be reset. The problem was the transfer from international to international: expect long lines for passport control (yes, they do have one) and security check. And no special line for gold members, business class. The line was huge and disorganized. Passengers with a European passports were eventually asked to bypass the main ine and line up for the automatized passport control, which was much quicker. Afterwards again disorganised line for security control. Lighters and larger power banks are not allowed. All electronic equipment (also Bluetooth headphones !) and wallets/purses had to be taken out of the bag... unfriendly staff. You should always calculate at least one hour and half for connecting flights. There is no smoking area at PEK airport, keep in this in mind if you book a long transit time. Air China business / gold lounge pretty full but OK (for the price again). The airport has several restaurants and many shops and is modern with big windows over the apron. Boarding to Tokyo HND began on time. The service for a 3 hour flight was good and quick, but not so friendly. The A321 was dirty: not only my tray table was dirty with stains (food, sauce?) and also the overhead bins and panels had grey stains. We arrived on time. Business class passengers and gold members didn't get their luggage before normal economy passengers. Overall I would say you pay for what you get.

Long haul flying with them is an endurance. Ground staff badly trained & disorganised with chaotic boarding procedures experienced at LGW, MAD and on the return from COR.

Expensive snacks sometimes available. I paid 5 euro for small bottle of water & pringles LGW to COR Unless you pay extra for reserving your seat during the online check in process, it is unlikely you will be able to sit in the part of the aeroplane that you would like.

Apart from the almost 1h delay from Lisbon to Madrid (which did not interfere with the connection flight, since we had a few hours between flights) everything went as smoothly as could be. The 787 provide great flight conditions, the staff was polite and available.

Some older passengers got shaken by his attitude. I have complained to local Air Europa female supervisor who did not supervise boarding. Instead she was hiding below the escalator with a male colleague. That is a clear job failure! They had no announcement about delayed boarding. They do not have boarding group lines organized and clearly marked. We had a similar experience in January in Madrid.

With budget airlines I am a great believer that one should start at 10 and take of points for what you don't like rather than with ""posh"" airlines the opposite. Bought my one way ticket for around £150 worth of airmiles so cheap as chips and consequently in fairness I should rate this airline with consideration to the fare paid. I've read reviews about Air Europa and feel like I must be flying a different airline. Check in was efficient and both members of staff were very helpful. I got given an exit seat at no charge (I am skyteam elite plus this probably helped). Air Europa use the cibelles lounge in T2, I had a very nice lunch in a relaxing setting before my flight. Boarding straightforward, plane new and clean. Flight left on time, we are scheduled to arrive on time. Meal was basic but tasted good. Reasonable selection of drinks, I am not an expert on wine, I guess it was cheap but was fine, the little dessert was delicious. Staff are friendly on this flight. Seat was old fashioned but consequently more comfortable than others I have sat on recently. Entertainment also not the best but some good films on a nice screen. So starting at 10 where do I dock points? I don't like they charge for ear phones but the next cheapest flight was a 100 quid more so money in the bank to pay 3 euro for earphones.

The fleet is handing out alcohol-free cleaning wipes that aren't even antibacterial. The plane looks like a jungle, passengers are moving everywhere and are talking in the aisle, being that it was clearly said at the beginning of the flight that crowds are not allowed in the aisles. People wear the masks without covering their nose, the fleet never distributed any alcohol in gel for sanitizing hands nor masks every 4 hours as it widely known and must be 100% know to airlines. There is no knowledge or transparency as to cleanliness, the Boarding was horrible, all the people piled up and the fleet of the plane controlled nothing. There are like 15 Air Europa workers on board (perhaps more) and none of them are doing anything. I paid to reserve my seat two days before my flight and upon arrival, I was printed the Boarding pass with the seat I booked. When I went to my seat there was a person with the same seat as me, no one in the fleet knew anything and they sent me to sit somewhere else, without giving me a solution. If you have claustrophobia or any reason for not being in a specific seat, never fly with this airline. The food felt like it was made for animals. The drink selection was horrible. Overall horrible experience, people being noisy, breaking every possible rule of biosecurity and the crew was doing nothing all day. I was forced to travel with this airline, but if I can choose again, I will never come with them again.

1669,Air France,1.0,"""business class service was nothing short of stellar""",2023-07-16,True," I am extremely impressed with the business class product on this international flight. The airplane has been in service for 24 years, but extremely well-kept. We had an hour delay due to a technical issue with one of the navigation instruments however Air France allowed us to stay in the terminal and not on the plane, something that I extremely appreciate. I was very disappointed, however, with fellow business class passengers for giving the crew a hard time because we were late due to the fact that they were trying to fix one of the navigational instruments. Really? You get upset because the delay is a safety issue that they are trying to fix before we take off on a 9 hour flight? Thank you Air France for ensuring that safety came first. I would have gladly waited as long as I had to! Once up in the air, the business class service was nothing short of stellar, the meals were all gourmet by a three star, Michelin Chef, the in-flight crew was warm, welcoming, personable, and genuine. I have to say that after this experience, the business class product on Air France for me, comes in at number 2. Qatar obviously still holds the 1st place for me. This airplane had been upgraded to the new business class configurations 1-2-1. I had a window seat (7A) and even though overall, I am not a big fan of the new “business class pods” industry wide, the seat was very comfortable with plenty of storage, and the entertainment options were very good. Amenity kit, headphones, a very nice pillow and duvet were also offered in business class. One thing I loved about Air France is that they give you free Wi-Fi to send text messages via ‎WhatsApp, Messenger, iMessage, and a few other messaging platforms, so you really do not need to purchase an Internet package unless you want to stream. The Internet on this flight worked from gate to gate without interruption of service. Overall, next time I go to Europe, I will most definitely have Air France on my top list. They are offering a business class product that the rest of their competitors in this market are not. Merci Air France for a safe and wonderful experience onboard!

1677,Air France,1.0,"""the worst airline experience we have had""",2023-06-26,True," Absolutely terrible experience with this airline. I flew to Paris with my friend at the end of May and at the airport was informed that even though we paid and did everything correctly with the booking, for some reason tickets were not issued. They let us stay at the airport handing us a paper with contact for AF customer service, where after a longer wait they said they don’t know how to deal with the problem so they have to think about it - I guess not realizing we are under a time pressure and could miss the flight - already in pressure and missed the time we wanted to stay at the airport lounge. After some time, they came up with a solution - to pay for the tickets again, yes, double charge us (in fact it was a triple charge) and said the previous hold would be released within 3 days, which did not happen within the period of time, but in the end it did. They also did not disrespect our selected seat we had chosen in the booking and wanted us to sit separately and also let us wait the line at the counter again, even though we had already waited before and was denied because of the technical issue on their side. After this horrible experience I contacted the airline explaining what a terrible experience we had with them, however we were not asking for any compensation or refund. They replied in quite a long time saying they issued a refund. I was surprised that they actually acknowledged how much they failed, but it was sadly not the thing - for some reason they thought I was asking for a refund because of the previous hold payment, which I was not. That means they did not even read my complaint properly and after another week I received an email my refund was denied. So not even the customer service employees care about the complaints, they probably don’t even read it. This is the worst airline experience we have had so far and we have flown hundreds of flights combined. Thankfully there is a great competition in the European and world airlines market and it’s easy to avoid flying with this terrible airline, which also means avoiding their sister KLM (and whole skyteam) which have allied with this terrible company.

1682,Air France,2.0,"""service and aircraft are not up to the standards""",2023-06-06,True," Would definitely never fly again with Air France or Delta. 1) I got my ticket from Delta and upgraded later to Premium Economy. The email I got from Delta says that my second checked luggage is free from JFK to IST (see attached photo). Air France ground crew at JFK said that it is free only for JFK to CDG and that I had to pay for CDG to IST although my bags were going directly to IST after checking in. Delta should have informed better as their email was grossly misleading. 2) My Premium Economy seat footrest was broken. It was basically not there so probably people who sat at this seat put their feet on the back pocket of the seat in-front of me so that was also broken (see attached photo). For an upgraded seat that I paid extra for it was uncomfortable and not worth it. A cabin crew member came later and told me they will send me a discount coupon of 45 euros on my next flight ticket with Air France and that is the only thing that they can do. 3) On both ways in CDG transfer while going to the US and coming back from the US and flying to IST there is a security control with long lines. Getting just out of one flight trying to catch another and you are again stuck with a security control. Overall I am very unhappy with my choices and would probably never fly again with Air France or Delta. And probably direct flight from Turkey to US would be better because the CDG is also not very entertaining and has very little options due to terminals/gates in terms of services, shops, food and lounges. These tickets are not cheap even if they are not upgraded and still the service and aircraft are not up to the standards.

On most airlines, the crew are either super salty or sickly sweet, and I would say this one was friendly and professional with authenticity. Flight was on time, arrived at CDG early, and all of our baggage made it to our final destination. I've flown with most airlines at this point, as I'm American and have to fly back home often to see family.

On the outbound flight, AF changed the plane (B777 with other cabin configuration) 10 hours before departure and we were downgraded to premium Economy, because there were not enough seats in the business.

1708,Air France,1.0,"""cabin crew were absolutely excellent""",2023-02-21,True,"  Boarding was done efficiently with Sky Priority/Business passengers allowed on first. It was a nearly-new A350 and looked immaculate. We were greeted by enthusiastic cabin crew and shown to our seats. I have always taken the view that there is always at least one thing wrong with any business seat but not on this occasion. It was extremely well designed with an excellent screen, solid table, privacy, ample storage spaces and the ability to locate switches and power points without searching too hard. We were offered a glass of champagne, juice or water before takeoff and given a very impressively comprehensive menu. I had pre-ordered the fish and it was incredibly tasty and excellently served by the cabin crew. I chose the delicious Chablis which seems to work well at altitude. It is an overnight flight and after the meal lights were dimmed. Although it was a flat bed seat I always believed that one sleeps better if it is at a slight angle – especially as aircraft never fly exactly horizontally. Despite only a blanket and pillow I had one of the most comfortable nights ever on an aircraft. I was awoken from breakfast and shown the omelette. This, I knew, never works that well but it was still tasty and accompanied by bread and fruit. Throughout the flight the cabin crew were absolutely excellent. Every request was answered and they were friendly, funny at times, very French (of course) and a credit to the airline.

Despite the relatively dated cabin interior (the plane took its first flight in 1999 according to a quick registration lookup), Air France more than makes up for it in convenience of a complimentary drink service (more than just water, but with hot and cold beverages), as well as some cookies as a snack. In addition compared to more budget options such as easyjet, AF's usage of jet bridges and the main CDG airport in Paris makes the journey overall much more convenient, as long as you don't mind spending a little more than budget offerings.",A319,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Bordeaux,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,yes,February,2023

Overall, a very decent product, and the flight was on time. They lost my luggage, so I did not have winter clothing as it was summer in South Africa.

At check-in, I encountered the most grim looking row of agents I'd ever seen. I understand they had to stay at work longer due to the delayed flight, but that isn't my fault and I expect some smiles and basic courtesy when checking in, particularly on a costly business class ticket. After completing check-in, I noticed that my bag tag was completely illegible because the printer was running out of ink. I returned to the check-in counter where I approached an agent who appeared to be lead agent on duty that night. I asked him in French if my bag tag can please be reprinted as it was unreadable. He started yelling at me (in French), ""Who did you see when you checked in...go to that person"". I stopped all proceedings and firmly responded, ""Why are you speaking to me like that!?"". He then told me curtly that the bag had already been sent for loading onto the aircraft. I told him that I was well aware of how the baggage system works, but I had simply asked if my bag tag could be reprinted. He continued to give me rude responses, at which point I told him to go into the system and find my baggage tag number and write it legibly on my boarding pass. I then went to the Air France station manager's office and complained. Shameful treatment of a high revenue passenger. Flights were fine. Air France lounges in Paris should stock non-alcoholic beer.

We pre-paid for our seats and we’re very pleased with the extra leg room outbound and the Solo seats coming home. I would like to thank all the staff from check in until when we landed.

I must have now called Air France a dozen times to find out the status of my claim. Each time, I get bounced around from one agent to another, each of whom appears completely unable to provide any help whatsoever. One agent today told me that the only way to communicate with AF is via social media and suggested I try Twitter and Facebook. I've already tried both of those months ago and never have had any response. I've now escalated the matter with my firm and with AMEX which did the booking as my company's corporate travel partner.

Way too expensive in relation to the journey length. Long queue on check-in at Copenhagen Airport. Seems to lack any service minded and professional customer service skills. Using terminal 3 for check-in would be preferable than terminal 2. The A330 was old and indeed outdated, a new interior or replacement of the transatlantic aircraft is needed. There is no Wi-Fi onboard, quality of the food was bad, very poor and old in-flight entertainment. 1 movie was shown and a few playlists were on, there were problems with their entertainment system, it to be reset some times before it worked. There is a very off-hand attitude among the staff, not least on board the transatlantic flight. Seriously, they don't seem to care about their customers! Though the short flight on the small Dash 8, was better. Arriving Copenhagen Airport, the waiting time for your luggage can be very long, this can take as long as up to 1 hour after arrival.

There were a lot of arguments in the plane with staff and ground clearance but they never listened. Most probably they did not have to fuel or their was an issue between pilot and ground staff as the pilot after being coerced after nearly 4 hours of no response from him announced that ground staff will speak.

2247,Air Mauritius,7.0,"""a pleasant experience""",2020-04-01,True,"  Mauritius to London Heathrow This was an unexpected and emergency flight back home due to the Coronavirus and booked at very short notice following advice from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in Mauritius due to the Border closures given the situation. In addition, the Kenya Airways / Qatar Airways flights to Nairobi and Doha / Manchester were all cancelled due to the Coronavirus, as the airlines were not flying on these routes, with no availability to travel until at least mid-April (this now appears unlikely as the Mauritius authorities have imposed restrictions). We were informed this was the last commercial flights to UK from Mauritius, so there was no option but to book and look to recoup costs back from Credit Card company give the crisis situation. This was reflected in the cost of the one way ticket to London Heathrow. Never have I seen Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam International Airport so deserted and quiet. However check in was easy. Boarding was a little chaotic, as this flight was full (this was a concern as it was impossible to evidence concepts of social distancing in the flight as would be expected given the impact of Coronavirus, though I wore a face mask for majority of the flight). Cabin crew themselves were dressed with appropriate Protective Equipment (PPE) for the 12 hour flight to reduce risks of infection. The flight itself represents an improvement from the last time I travelled with Air Mauritius some 25 years ago !. Cabin crew were kind, friendly and attentive and service has improved. The meals sadly are of poor quality. Lukewarm, with little in the way of decent portion size (though they provided my Vegetarian Special meal). Bread was stale unfortunately, and the dessert was an odd combination of rice and sugary milk ?? Menus were not provided, which is a shame. The inflight entertainment is ok, and the flight map and routing was good. Unfortunately could not connect to the complimentary WIFI online, as it would not recognise my booking details. In summary, definite improvements noted with Air Mauritius which was welcome. The new Airbus A330neo is a lovely aircraft. Pilot gave timely announcements. Sadly the toilets were not being attended to (perhaps more due to some of the ignorant passengers onboard whom have no empathy for the airline or the crew).The only deficits as mentioned was the meal quality, otherwise it was good. A great shame I could not get a connection back to Manchester (due to the Coronavirus, but good a rental car for a quick 3 hour drive to Manchester Airport from Heathrow to collect my car and get back home). I would travel with Air Mauritius again if need be - most likely from Mauritius to destinations such as India, Malaysia and local regional areas such as Reunion Island, Rodrigues and Seychelles. As for long haul, it’s ok, but 12 hours with Air Mauritius is a bit too much and will revert back to Qatar Airways or Emirates for future travel between Manchester and Mauritius.

When I sat on my allocated seat my IFE system wasn't working. Not only for me but the column 30-40 ABC. Our hostess were not professional.

Passengers were barred from entering the airport building as the flight was delayed to avoid overcrowding and a makeshift counter without personnel was arranged and of course without a proper seating facility. There were hardly 15 chairs for more than 100 people. As it is summer in Saudi Arabia the temperature outside was around 40 degrees Celsius. The airline representative appeared once in a while and responded rudely to any queries on flight status. Experience inside the plane is another horrible experience. We felt like we were in an airplane just because it was flying. Other than that it is comparable to local buses in developing countries. Seats were small and uncomfortable even with economy standards. Regarding the food, I bet it cannot be any cheaper than what was served. I have pledged not to travel with Air India anymore.

The plane was so old that the seats and infotainment systems were broken. People were literally trying to change seats to watch something in the screens. The most ridiculous part of all is that a manual in airlines said to not remove shoes. The people removed shoes and literally lied down on the seats, with blankets on, as if it were their beds at home. The crew did not care and was least concerned about correcting the mess. The washrooms were clogged and stinky. The attendant call was not heard for 45 minutes and till the time I stopped one myself to ask for water. I hated my overall flight experience.

We were made to stand for one hour before boarding and the gate agents were never advised by the Captain that the flight would be delayed as the plane had to be cleaned! The board stated that we were leaving on time though this was clearly not the case. All they had to do is post a new departure time instead of leaving the original departure time on the board. I suspected something fishy in Cagliari when I noticed that 2 of their flights to Milan were over one hour delayed. Fortunately we flew Alitalia on this route. The food was awful except for the pasta dish which was served lukewarm. The seats were not completely flat but this did not bother me. The Purser insisted that everyone on the plane put their shades down though this was a day flight. The whole economy section was in the dark! He kept on putting my shades down without my permission. When I told him no the 3rd time as I was reading he told me to put the light on. I insisted on keeping half of one shade up. Their Dining on Demand like on Qatar and Etihad is a joke! They don't follow the time you request to eat and even forgot the desert. If they can't do it properly don't do it! The steward got angry with my travelling companion because she fell asleep between the hour we asked to wait for the entree after we had finished the appetizer. He had to reopen her tray table and the tablecloth had fallen to the floor. Seats are not fully flat but this did not bother me. The economy class legroom looked awful too.

After few days of attempts our tour operator in Madagascar was lucky to get in touch with them locally. We asked at least to move our return flight so we can stay in Madagascar as many days as planned. We were not surprised when our return flight to Paris was moved to the following day. We contacted the airline on the day of the flight to check and they couldn't confirm the exact date and time of the departure. They didn't offer accommodation. So as a result, we had to completely reschedule our tour including all hotels etc.; we missed 2 connection flights from London to Paris return (we live in London). We also had one domestic flight with this airline to Morondava. This flight was also cancelled and then rescheduled the night before the flight.

Worst of all we did not get our luggage and the airline made no attempt to help us track it.

Unfortunately WiFi which is complimentary for Business class passengers, was out of service, which was disappointing. Seats are lie-flat bed type and are comfortable with enough space.

I had 4 flights with Air Mauritius. 1 was cancelled without notifying me and then rebooked for a departure a day later, another delayed by 3 hours and the aircraft substituted with a smaller plane. As a result of the plane substitution, all pre-arranged seating allocations were scrubbed and worse seats allocated instead. The inflight entertainment didn't work and to top it off, my partner and I were asked by the purser to move so a 10 year old boy could sit in a very slightly different configured seat with his mother to the one that they had been allocated. No other passengers were asked to move. Ground crew and on board crew carried out their jobs in a perfunctory and robotic manner, going through the motions, but not really caring at all. The inflight fish curry meal was good. The web site provides limited and misleading (or no relevant information at all) particularly in relation to updated seating maps and airline lounge arrangements.. When I called the Service Centre I was told that when I arrived in transit from Australia into Kular Lumpur on an Air Mauritius code share I would have to collect my baggage and recheck it in. This was incorrect, as was the information I was told as to which airline lounge to use. All first world problems I suppose... and perhaps not the biggest of issues for an airline from the third world. Service was passable and safety good, but nothing more and cannot be recommended. One of my flights was on an A340 which was looking very dated, particularly from an inflight entertainment (tiny screen) and seat comfort perspective (rigid, won and uncomfortable).

I’m a 90kgs guy and my nightmare started once the flight took off with the front passenger who decided its time to rest so she leaned her seat backwards. I was squeezed, even the magazines I couldn’t read as the space was very tight. Arrived the time for lunch,the hostess served her and didn’t inform her she need to put her seat back to its normal position, I’m the one you did it by tapping on her arm to please move forward so I can eat properly. She wasn’t very happy by me asking but I couldn’t care more as I paid to travel. I saw the hostess distributing a small backpack bag to the kids then again nothing for my daughter and I asked this time,what the criteria to qualify to receive?

Unfortunately, my concerns were proved right. We flew them from Perth to Johannesburg, with a 3 day stopover in Mauritius. Upon arrival in Perth, we discovered that the inbound flight was cancelled which meant an overnight stay in Perth. The replacement flight was due to leave at 8.30am the following morning. Upon arrival to the airport we discovered this had changed to 9.30am. 20mins after boarding was due to start, the flight crew stroll into the airport lounge, none of them worrying or rushing to get going, the end result being a further 90min delay to an already 20hr delay. Upon boarding the plane, we sat down in seats that had an entertainment system from the 90s, not even worth having there. On board service consisted of a snack and drink, followed by lunch and a drink shortly after. We did not hear from the cabin crew again for another 5hrs (prepare to be thirsty). Even when pressing the button for flight crew service, nobody came to my seat to assist, with flight crew even walking straight past the service light on the panel above the seats.

To top it off one of the air hostesses rolled her eyes at us on three separate occasions: when she had to give way to us in the passage, when we asked her to remove the empty cups and when my husband needed the bathroom before landing.

Overall a very good experience and more so due to the great staff the company has on its team. The Tauranga lounge is great, nice and quiet, nice outlook and good food and drink selection. Not so good at the Auckland International lounge, always seems crowded now and as long as you like Curry you’ll like the food. I retreated to my normal spot right down the back with a view of the runway. If there’s one area Air New Zealand can't seem to get right (in NZ that is) it is the boarding procedure. They don’t stagger it properly and hence it’s a stampede with everyone on the flight seemingly claiming to be a Koru Club member and it’s just chaos. Excellent flight across to the US, superb staff, great food, good alcohol and a lovely bed, hence nearly 8 hours of good sleep. They had run out of my first choice for dinner, I wanted the Rib Eye Steak. Nothing else appealed so they made me up a dinner to die for (Free Range chicken) which more than compensated for the unavailability of my first choice. The return flight was equally as enjoyable. Boarding at LAX was a breeze as it was done properly, it was staggered and I wasn’t trampled to death in any stampede. Meals were great (lamb that was so tender), top quality alcohol and the best crew ever and a special shout out to Mel who had everyone’s names memorized right from the start and she worked tirelessly the whole flight.

Same 2-4-2 seating but in each row of middle four there was one seat empty so the configuration in the middle was actually 1-2. After reading so much bad press about Air NZ it was a surprise that the cabin crew made a huge effort to walk around the premium economy cabin and introduce themselves to each passenger by name, there was also a hot towel. But what made the Air NZ premium product vastly superior was the friendliness of the crew, they made an effort to replenish drinks and chat to customers and provided excellent service!

Tablets and laptops will bend or snap if you attempt to store them here. The seats also offer only a half seat that doesn’t come to the back of your knees even for very short people. The portion size for meals are smaller than the size of an iPhone 14 Pro Max (not an exaggeration) and meal choices were limited after the first 9 rows as they had run out.

The meals were of very good quality. The return journey started out with a bump at check in at LAX. A lot of people (including myself) did now know that a Travelers Declaration had to be filled out online before you could enter New Zealand.

When I was in the Star Alliance Lounge later, the same manager from check in made sure I had got the Travelers Declaration sorted and wished me well for the rest of the journey, top marks for remembering me and checking that I was all sorted.. The rest of the journey home was seamless and just like the Air New Zealand of old, pre covid. The staff were attentive and helpful. Nothing was too much bother for the staff.

So I board among the last, and at the boarding they said they changed my seat from 3A to 30C which is the last row of the plane near the bathroom. They don’t even know the reason, that’s how good that are. My advice to everyone - don’t fly with Air Serbia- no customer service at all.

I missed my shuttle bus to Istanbul Sabiha airport and had to take the taxi in order not to miss my flight from SAW on New Year's eve (100km distance). We arrived at 19:00 local time instead of 15:55. Scheduled departure 12:20. The aircraft (YU-API) arrived one hour late from Milan. On departure we were notified that the catering truck has broken down. Then boarding started at 13:00. At 14:00 we were informed the crew duty hours have expired. We departed only around 15:00. Time at gate on arrival at IST was 19:00. Then we discovered that Air Serbia has been transporting hundreds of Lufthansa bags from Frankfurt which was the real reason of the delay. Passengers were unable to get their luggage cause the baggage carousel (meant for A320) has been blocked by Lufthansa bags coming from a wide-body from Munich (flight waited in Belgrade). It is horrible that Air Serbia gives priorities on New year's holidays to bags from Lufthansa than to their own passengers. Our bags arrived last. Finally i received my luggage at 19:30 and had one hour to arrive at an airport 100km away (6 hours planned for that trip). The taxi  cost me 55 Eur. (60.61 USD).

2804,Air Seychelles,1.0,""" my worst flight experience""",2023-04-24,True,"  Flew Air Seychelles from Seychelles to Mauritius (had to take this as this would be the only direct option with a high price of $300+), and this became my worst flight experience in my life as my original departure time of Apr. 19, 10:00 eventually became Apr. 20, 15:10. A transactional email arrives the night before the flight that the flight will be delayed but new flight time will be released later on, shattering my sleep already as I am in fear that my travel plans will be disrupted (and it did in a serious manner). Had to be at the airport on time nonetheless (as I now know that Air Seychelles will never care about my travel plans and therefore I will have to be at the airport to be at the scene myself) and another email arrives that 13:20 would be the new departure time. But then nothing happens and nobody at the check-in counter knows what is going on except that there is a ""discussion"" about the flight's fate if it would fly out on 13:20 as planned or not (and it did not). Finally, at around 11:00 an Air Seychelles temporary employee approaches the passengers that the flight is ""decided"" to be delayed (a quick check on its two A320 Neos reveal that they are flying other routes instead, but no explanations were given at all so how would I know what is happening at all) and that all passengers will have to stay where Air Seychelles sends them to. All passengers end up taking the bus provided by Air Seychelles (after loading their luggage on an open truck's cargo hold) and are all bussed to a terrible resort about 30 minutes away from the airport. Then rooms were assigned arbitrarily (couples were okay but solo travelers were randomly assigned rooms together) and a terrible lunch buffet with only one free non-alcoholic beverage was offered (not even a meal voucher as that would be so much more expensive to the airline). Then we were told by Air Seychelles that the flight could depart any time that day or the day after and that the passengers should wait for the call in their hotel rooms (that is, someone should be in the hotel room instead of being at the beach in front of the resort) as well as frequently consult Air Seychelles Facebook page for updates. Then the hotel calls that passengers should gather by 11:00 the next morning without even telling us what the new departure time would be (had to check myself via the aforementioned Facebook page that the new departure time had been announced as Apr. 20, 15:10). Then the next morning, once again the weird bussing back from the hotel to the airport, and then found out that an Ethiopian B737-MAX8 was there to run the route instead. Checked-in and finally departed at around 15:40, landing in Mauritius at around 18:00 (a whopping ~30 hour delay). Cannot say much about the aircraft and in-flight service as it was provided by Ethiopian Airlines, but it was pretty basic with basic seats without any IFE and a tiny sandwich given during the flight (alcoholic beverages were available though). At the end of the day, my Mauritius travel plans were disrupted without any reimbursement of any kind from the airline for the losses. I heard before that Air Seychelles had financial troubles in the past and now I think understand why.

I  booked a confirmed Air Seychelles Mumbai to Dar Es Salaam via Mahe return flights on January 2016 for July 2016. A month later we were informed that Air Seychelles has stopped flying that route and has shifted us to Etihad flight via Abu Dhabi. I confirmed with the Mumbai office of Air Seychelles and the flight was confirmed. A week before flying I checked with Etihad online and they informed me that my Abu Dhabi to Dar es Salaam sector was not confirmed. Neither Air Seychelles nor Etihad had taken the effort to inform me of this situation in spite of purchasing a confirmed ticket in January! If I had not followed up I would have been stranded in Abu Dhabi. The Air Seychelles ground office in Mumbai was equally clueless. Repeated emails from them to Air Seychelles and Etihad (on highest priority I was told) went unanswered. Only after I threatened to take action did they swing into action and book us on Kenya Airways. As a gesture we were informed that a special request for upgrade to Business class has been put but of course as expected there was no record on the system during check in. Also the complimentary chauffeur service from Etihad was not available as the PNR was 'not registered' in the system. The only explanation that I was offered was 'a system glitch'. This is irresponsible of both Air Seychelles and Etihad. I will definitely not be flying either airline. I would rather pay more and go by a more reliable airline like Emirates or Qatar Airways.

Our flight departure time was at 14h00 and the arrival time in Mahe very close to midnight. From Johannesburg the service was extremely slow as our trays were cleared more than an hour after the service commenced. I will not even comment on the food served as my tray went straight to their exit bin. The departure time from Johannesburg is clearly problematic if one considers the crew on duty had just come from Seychelles and with a turnaround of possibly an hour or less, they must have been on duty from very early morning. It would be interesting to know whether the same crew returns the aircraft or whether there was indeed another crew returning to Seychelles. If a different crew did duty on the return flight then their tardy service is unforgiveable. If the reverse is true, then surely their hours on duty exceeded the norm. For folk travelling from South Africa and seated in the economy class, sleep well the night before your departure. Do not try and extend your seat and then expect the passenger behind you to be happy having a stranger sleeping on their lap - when service starts you have to be asked to please place your seat in the upright position. On our return the menu was just as terrible - fancy being told they do not have the omelette which is first on their very fancy menu card and your choice is frittata or bread pudding for breakfast. The service was better, the crew were well trained but the noise from passengers and children was chronic, we at times wished their was an escape route and a parachute available.

2883,Air Tahiti Nui,1.0,"""Business Class product was terrible""",2022-10-19,True,"  Their lack of care, lack of support and lack of customer service is monumental. My wife and I were celebrating our anniversary and heading to Bora Bora. Air Tahiti from LAX to Papeete and then on Air Tahiti (regional carrier) to Bora Bora. About 2 hours prior to our late night flight, Air Tahiti Nui cancelled the flight. The reason was that the incoming aircraft was struck by lightning. Understanding that safety is paramount and absolutely the most important factor of traveling, we understood that the aircraft had to be inspected. Keep in mind that Air Tahiti Nui only has like 4 aircraft in their fleet so it's not like they can quickly bring in a new aircraft. We were shuttled to an airport hotel at LAX and told to come back in the next day as the flight would now depart at 2pm. Back to LAX we went and learned that Air Tahiti Nui kept delaying the flight with no information or communication to the passengers. When a Gate Agent did appear, we were advised that they are third party employees and have no further details. All this while we were watching tape being put on the front of the aircraft where it was struck by lightning. After hours again in LAX, the flight finally departed. Upon arrival in Tahiti there was no one from Air Tahiti Nui to provide hotel vouchers (as the majority of passengers were connecting to neighboring islands and there were no regional flights out that late). There was a line of about 200+ passengers waiting for some assistance from one woman sitting in the Air Tahiti office! After hours of waiting we were put up in literally a dump of a motel for the night. Knowing that the flight was cancelled the previous day, why would they not have staff ready to assist their passengers as well as hotel vouchers for those stuck in Papeete. Take my recommendation, fly an alternate carrier if going to Tahiti. Their Business Class product was terrible. 2x2x2 seating on a 787 where others offer plenty more room. Inflight entertainment was very limited and food was ""just OK' but nothing I would expect from a flag carrier. Internet never worked and while flight attendant service was very cordial, it certainly does not make up for their lack of customer service. We lost nights in Bora Bora and I have written a letter to Air Tahiti Nui and the response basically was ""sh*t happens"". Air France, United, Delta would be the carriers of choice.

The shut down occurred on a Friday and we could not catch a flight home until the following Wednesday which resulted in 5 more hotel nights. Air Tahiti charged us $1,048.00 per ticket for the flight home in the same class of service. If we didn't pay the $1,048.00 per ticket, Air Tahiti wanted to charge us $90.00 per ticket to drop down a class.

I was lucky enough to be seated on an aisle seat but for outboard PAX on LH & RH side, it is just a headache to get access to the aisle. This seat does not have enough personal belongings storage and feet area is just to narrow to have a great sleeping position.

This was the first time flying Air Tahiti Nui.  My goal was to fly from LAX to PPT (Tahiti) then PPT to BOB (Bora Bora). The nightmare started on our flight from LAX to PPT. Discovered Air Tahiti Nui does not have a designated ticket counter so you can only check in 2 hours before flight departs. This caused an issue because in order to gain access to any club lounge you need a boarding pass. Our flight arrived in LAX about 5 hours before the LAX to PPT departed so had to sit and wait in LAX for 3 hours until Air Tahiti Nui ticket counter opened. By that time there was a long line of people and the staff at Air Tahiti Nui did not seem to care how fast they processed people. So we were not able to go to our lounge and eat and relax so we had to pay for our lunch and stand around because of very limited seating in the lobby of LAX. After checking our bags we went to the gate displayed on my ticket and on the overhead boards and on my flight app. Several people started going up the the gate ticket counter asking why boarding had not started with only 10 minutes before our flight was suppose to depart. No answers. Staff simply did not seem to care. Five minutes before boarding an announcement was made of a gate change to 153 which was about 1/2 mile away all the way down to the other end of the concourse. We ran to the the other end only to wait 1.5 hours to board with more delays and no explanation. During this time I talked to a couple the long time LAX employees. They stated this happens all the time with Air Tahiti Nui. During our flight we purchase exit row seats. The Air Tahiti Nui staff allowed long lines to queue up and use our exist row areas as acceptable areas for people to stand and stretch, causing people to step on our feet several times. We brought this to the attention of the staff but they did not seem to care. Service was touted a very friendly and a great Tahitian experience. Do not believe what they tell you and show in their slick ads. We had a similar experience on way back. Sorry but once from LAX to PPT and PPT to LAX was enough. There are a lot of other airline choices like Air France etc. I would look elsewhere. Hopefully this review helped describe our experience.

We eventually got an email that said they aren't going to cover the cost of our hotel and we would need to go through travel insurance for reimbursement. Too bad we didn't have a current travel insurance plan. We called to try to get compensated in some way so we requested a free upgrade to premium economy. They said they might not have room but will add notes to our reservation for the ticket counter staff to upgrade us if there was room. 3 hrs before departure we arrive at the ticket counter and they had no idea what we were talking about as there were no notes added.

Once on the plane I realised how uncomfortable the seats were, hard and no leg room. The service is terrible as they barely speak english and don't seem to care about customers. They served drinks once on the flight and would not get a coke for me so they just gave the terrible orange juice that was served with breakfast. The food was horrible.

We never heard Club Class being called, yet heard they will be calling by groups. They called 2-5, then shortly after added 6&7. We lined up and while in line my spouse went up to the counter and inquired about Club Class, and the Attendant said “we did, you missed it”. Nothing else, so she joined me back in line. I  mentioned it to the Attendant while being greeted coming aboard and she simply, “well all those people did” (gesturing to the 8 of the 12 people seated in Club Class).  So after paying for Club Class, what was our reward - arriving at our seats to find the overhead cabins were unavailable. Understandable, as they are used for staff/plane storage. Acceptable but no alternative immediately available until the gentleman seated next to us offered us space. For the extra value spent, it was a horrible beginning to a long-awaited trip to Spain. Hoping our return trip is much better! In todays challenging environment, it seems like customer service is hit or miss.

Boarding chaotic and priority order not respected. On our last trip we were travelling in club class and our luggage had special tags and were supposed to be delivered first at arrival - they lost our suitcase. Their website instruct passengers to contact their agent at the airport, but there was no air Transat agent or desk at Basel airport. The airline was totally unhelpful and to date we have not heard anything from them or any other party regarding our lost luggage.

Furthermore the check in staff at Gatwick were aware I would miss my flight and were unable to rebook my itinerary. Really poor customer experience. Furthermore following the loss of my baggage the airline handed my luggage to a really poor no name courier firm at Toronto who are seemingly unable to communicate.

They charged $11 for headphones, which people were unable to use due to there being no TVs, etc. This was a completely different experience from our other flight with Air Canada, who had USB A and USB C outlets, as well as standard AC outlets, had the screens with a bunch of entertainment options (movies, shows, maps), the drinks were standard size drinks (ie, a full soda can) We’ll definitely avoid flying Air Transat again, as it appears they cut costs in comfort.",A231CEO,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Vancouver to Montreal,4.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,no,June,2022

Or if I was a member of team mobile! On each flight, they are lacking in overhead luggage space so they ask anyone wanting to check a bag will get the ability to get on the plane in group C. So much of an advantage. They don't seem to take the time to clean the aircraft in-between flights. They barely give you the included beverage. They have no in-flight movies unless you have your own mobile device which I couldn't use for their 700 free movies because I couldn't get into it without paying for streaming, but I was able to get into their commercial. They don't have enough space overhead, but if you don't bring on your own device, you are sitting there with nothing to do for 5 hours because you can't get it on your phone. In fact being on the plane is like one big commercial. They ask you if you want to open up their credit card and all the wonderful things you will get after you accrue 30,000 miles. Then the final thing, your luggage will be there in 20 minutes or we will give you some air miles.

I paid for a premium seat upgrade, and the seat was super narrow and not worth the extra cost. There was no under seat storage for two of the three seats in my row. The overhead bins are miniscule and they ran out of space before half the plane was boarded. The flight attendants were fairly inattentive to their movements and rammed into me multiple times, despite being fully out of the aisle. When beverage service started i spent a solid 5 minutes with the second seat flight attendant's bum repeatedly being shoved in my face. I understand they have a job to do, but the lack of respect for passengers space is abysmal. The airlines need to consider this when designating aisle space. The curtain separating first class is not tied/otherwise secured, and i spent 90% of the flight with it flapping in my face (seat C6). This airline is one of the worst I've had the misfortune to fly with. Every trip has been subpar, but to charge for premium seating and  cram people in like sardines in this row is outrageous. Delta or southwest are far preferable because even when they're awful, they're better than Alaska on a good day.

However the flight attendants on this flight seem to be fit and are not overweight at all, which is mind boggling to me because neither one of them walking by that pushed bumped or ran into my arm with the cart are overweight or obese so in my mind there’s no reason why they should be bumping me in the aggressive way they have been this whole flight so far. Neither of them apologized or even acknowledged me when they did bump into me I find it very unprofessional and unpleasant and I don’t plan on flying with Alaska again after this experience. Even someone on the plane twice the size of Gail turned to where she wasn’t bumping into me.

We get to Seattle to find out the snowboard bag didn’t even make it on the flight. We lost hundreds of dollars not having our equipment for this trip. Our return flight on Christmas Day was canceled due to “mechanical issues” and we were told they couldn’t get us out until the 28th.

We are missing all of our connecting flights because the flight attendant was over an hour late for our first flight out of Seattle. We then had to de-plane because of an electrical issue.

Our last two trips, all in 2022, have had our flights changed multiple times including loss of our premium seats and reassigned to horrible seats. Both trips we used our companion ticket. The trip to Costa Rica was booked LAX to SJO non-stop but both on the trip down and back have added a stop in Liberia which Alaska used as an excuse to bump us from our premium seats. Our trip back to the States, we checked in showing stop in Liberia and confirmed premium seats and purchased food only to wake up and find they had changed it again showing no stop to Liberia and loss of premium seats from LAX to PDX (giving us a seat with no windows). No food. We are now boarded and informed we are stopping in Liberia even though our boarding pass shows direct to LAX. I don’t know what is going on but they are no longer reliable in terms of booking a flight or picking a seat. Count yourself lucky if you get on a flight.

During check-in, their seat map is mysteriously “not available”, so you can’t verify your seats. I have no idea why they do that. I probably wouldn’t care if they had respected my aisle seating but they couldn’t even do that.

From customer service to the ticket agent to the flight attendants, I could not be more pleased. They boarded the plane first with the flight crew and departed the plane last with the flight crew. We were allowed to escort them to their gate and sit with them until they boarded the plane and were in the air. They checked their aunts ID upon arrival and ours when they returned. I felt they were safe and as a parent, I needed to know they were safe. The kids had a blast and the flight attendants said they were well behaved and polite.

I was willing to use the main cabin restroom, and I had used the main cabin restroom previously. This one time, though, there was an excessive line. I have a bladder issue, unfortunately, and waiting in line to use the restroom would have been difficult as I was in pain. So, I went to try to use the first class restroom. When I attempted to use the first class restroom, I was met with resistance by the stewardesses in that the stewardesses would not allow me to use the restroom. The flight attendant stood in front of me and stated “ the bathroom is in the back.” I explained to both how I have a bladder issue and I am in need to use the bathroom. They both stated I am not in first class and that I need to go use the bathroom in the back. I explained that there is a long time and I was unable to wait due to my pain. She shrugged her shoulders and stated I was not in first class and I cannot use that bathroom. They had no empathy and put arbitrary rules above a passenger’s physical well being.

After those advantages the rest was not much better than standard economy. The food service was ho-hum and there was no liquor available even on a trans Atlantic flight.

Not once have I ever been on a flight with Allegiant that has been departed on time. I learned my lesson a long time ago, but this trip was booked by my parents who swear “it’s not that bad”. Imagine my surprise when we get a text notification as we are walking into the airport that we are looking at a 2.5hr delay. Great news with two senior citizens and two kids under the age of 11 and one toddler. After looking at FlightAware I found that this was a rolling delay that had been hours in the making. This notification could have been sent out hours before just like any other airline notifies their customers. So, now we are sitting at a small regional airport for more than two additional hours with small children with an ETA of 1AM. Ideal situation. Upon arrival we were told that our baggage would delivered to carousel 3 but instead it was a delivered to carousel 6 (in another building). This was only after entire A320 worth of passengers with screaming tired children waited for over an hour. Our return trip was no different. We arrived to Sanford to be treated by a departure board showing 22/32 flights delayed. Three gate changes one plane change after boarding, three hours of waiting we board our “new” plane. Just like any terrible infomercial, “but wait there’s more”! After boarding we waited over an hour for them to load the baggage. I don’t know who thought loading everyone onto a plane with 10 children under the age of two BEFORE the baggage was a good idea after more than a two hour delay, but they need to find a new line of work where common sense and consideration are not necessary.

My flight departed from the rather small-sized Terminal 4, and with the amount of layover I had plus the quick service in Los Angeles, I had plenty of time to kill in the Admirals Club lounge which was very cozy and comfortable. The staff in Los Angeles were just okay. Boarding started on schedule and it was very disciplined, and I was welcomed in quite a friendly way by the crews. Take-off was only 10 minutes late, but eventually, we landed half an hour ahead of schedule. Their A321 had slightly larger overhead bins and strip LED lighting, but sadly no personal TVs. The seat was cozy and comfortable, easy to use, and adequately spacious for a 2.5-hour flight like this.

It allowed me to browse anything, open social media apps, and watch videos on the ground for around 20 minutes. Once I took off, the social media apps and browsing feature no longer existed, but live TV shows, videos, movies, and games were provided through the American Airlines portal. The signal strength was quite poor, but the contents and the layout of the portal were incredibly good. Despite landing 30 minutes ahead of schedule, the baggage delivery at Dallas Fort Worth was ridiculously slow, causing me to wait around 45-60 minutes.

The previous day that sent an email that ask to change flights and be compensated. I refused as I had a planned schedule. Since I refused to delay voluntarily I think they just booted me to the later flight. In PHX we were switched to three different gates and two different flights.

We had left our vehicle in ABQ and were suppose to pick it up around 7 PM for our drive home.

The flight attendant for business was curt, draconian in approach, and very stingy with snacks. I have flown this route numerous times and when I have asked for more than one item it was gladly given - .not the case until the entire cabin was served per the statement of this attendant, and even then, when she returned and I watched her stow the leftover snacks and I asked it was given to me with a bit of a frustrated attitude on her part. The other issue is that in prior flights on CRJ 900s, I have always been able to stow a rollaboard, which can be easily stowed above the seats the right side of this aircraft. When I asked this attendant why the policy had changed, she was rather impertinent stating that this had always been the policy by law (i.e. the need to check rollaboards). You can check your records to see how often I have flown this route from either SRQ to Charlotte or DCA and I was always allowed to bring a bag on board. I sense that my question, which was very diplomatically phrased, was not appreciated and led to the rest of our less than satisfactory interaction. I have flown American for years and prior to the pandemic was in Executive Platinum status for many of them. It is discouraging to have had a rude attendant, particularly when we paid to be in business class. It was also interesting to her how soft and welcoming her demeanor became when advertising the credit card and is associated amenities. Please understand that I don't like giving negative information nor do I wish to complain. These are challenging times for the airlines as well as passengers who fly them.

4318,American Eagle,1.0,"""a vast contrast""",2016-06-01,False,"  Flew American Eagle from Columbus to New York. There is a vast contrast between flying American Airlines mainline and American Eagle. American Eagle (AE) is to be avoided if you have any other option, especially if your route uses one of their old embraer or bombardier planes that insist on gate checking roll on bags, CRJ700, ERJ140 and ERJ145. American Airlines mainline are my airline of choice especially when flying internationally. I fly AE in and out of Columbus frequently to connect with the AA mainline international flights. I used to book Delta Connect (DC) flights on separate tickets to avoid AE but the DC schedules changed making that option impractical. As examples, with AE you have a 50/50 chance of arriving in Columbus and having to wait a couple of hundred yards back from the gate for about 10 minutes until the below wing ground handlers saunter out of their break room to marshall the aircraft onto stand. You can then wait an average of 15-20 minutes to have your gate checked bag delivered back to the jet bridge. DC normally do this in under 3 minutes for the same aircraft type. If you hold check a bag you better allow yourself a full 45 minutes before it will be delivered on the carousel. With any weather disruptions anywhere in the AA network they will delay and cancel the AE flights, especially the flights in and out of their 2nd tier bases, to the benefit of the mainline and hub flights. Then you will get a shrug of the shoulders from their staff and a statement that because it is weather related the airline bears no responsibility for any delays etc.. You will have about a 20% chance of a maintenance issue on any given flight with this older fleet. Normally it will take 20 minutes to fix the issue and then typically an hour to update the maintenance logbook before you journey can continue. It is unfortunate that the AE below wing operations are so bad as their above wing staff do appear to hustle and to be nice to the passengers.",E145,Business,Premium Economy,CMH to LGA,3.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,no,May,2016

The effort, cleanliness, quality and excellent service of the Japanese food and care from the flight attendants is superior!  The food tastes freshly steamed and cooked with juicy flavors from the main dish, whereas the small side dishes tastes great, plus mini ice cream for dessert! Entertainment was great too. I even like how they even set up a warning about safety concerns for turbulence impact, reminding to wear your seatbelt and PA announcements on the mini TV screen. The cleanliness in the aircraft, the space and comfortably is superb! My only concern is the room space for the leg space for the economy class in the very back seat which is connected to the wall. Either way, the seat itself with the pillows and the blankets are pretty comfortable and clean!  I highly recommend to anyone to look into ANA, their honesty about operating during a pandemic crisis like at this time is strongly recommended to those who are struggling to return to their homes.

Excellent service began from check-in, with dedicated check-in room and security screening area. ANA Suite Lounge was nice, but I some how found SQ Private Room at Changi, QF First Class Lounge at SYD and the Concorde Room at JFK better. My flight was exactly the day after ANA launched its new 777 configuration to JFK, so I got stuck with the old version. However, the cabin was sparkling clean and showed no need for upgrading. My complaint was mainly about obstructed view from the Cube, and lack of storage space providing the size of the suite. Lavatory was underwhelming for first class, especially when comparing to my experience on the new SQ Suites just a week earlier. Catering was excellent, as expected from ANA. I picked the Western menu with a lot of skepticism but then was surprised about how tasty the dishes were. The wagyu steak was indeed overcooked, as anticipated on board a flight, but it was, at the same time, tender, juicy, and flavorful.

This happens even though we strictly follow ANA'S online reservation system guideline on how to input names for people from various countries. I explained this to the ground staff at Narita and Haneda multiple times but their response is usually that the reservation system is handled by another department. Discrepancy between reservation system and check in system is definitely a possibility. I can't add my miles because ANA mile systems has a totally different rule for passengers without dedicated first name and last name.

At LAX, boarding was chaotic. They don't have an organized boarding system. Everybody rushed in to board no matter what your seat number is. I found this to be very frustrating. The service is pretty much comparable to other premier Asian carriers. The economy seats are quite similar as well, although it has more cushion and softer. The B777 aircraft is an older version enroute to Seoul. The food is ok, not great as I was expecting. In my opinion they should just serve the Bibimbap enroute to Seoul and something different should be served in between Seoul and Manila and Seoul to LAX. That kind of explains why they have toothbrushes and mouthwash in the lavatories. While on transit in Seoul, the seats in the boarding gates are so stiff. I looked around for better seats to rest and I couldn't find any. The room is also small that there aren't enough seats for everybody. Some passengers just stood and wait for the next flight. Upon boarding, everybody rushed in again without any order. There still is no systematic boarding, unlike China Southern, EVA Airways, Cathay Pacific and Air China. Because of this, I promised myself not to book future flights with Asiana. The B747 for the connecting flight was refreshing as it is wider than the B777 and the seats are more comfortable.

Friendly check-in, received baggage tag and headed to the gate. Flight boarded in an organized fashion and flight attendants greeted each passenger as you entered the cabin. Nice colors and comfortable seats. Lots of legroom actually - was very surprised. On-time take off and 2 hours to the Faroe islands - soda, water and coffee serviced complimentary but purchased wine and food was reasonably priced. Inflight entertainment was just the flight-map but had my DVD's to watch. Landed a few minutes late in crazy wind and rain, but the landing was good. Parked farthest possible on the tarmac from the entrance to the terminal so we all got wet, but that is how it is there. Bags off in a reasonable amount of time.

In the Boeing 777 it was comparable with the other air lines. Flights left on time. Overall that was one of my best flights in recent years. One thing to flag is that there was no WIFI though it should have been.

4904,Avelo Airlines,1.0,"""staff service was non-existent""",2023-04-06,False," Avelo Airlines has to be one of the worst flights I've ever experienced. You really get what you pay for. We were rushed to sit down by very pushy staff, claiming we had to disembark if the plane was not seated at a certain time because they ""had a late start to their day"" because they didn't want to pay for the noisy aircraft fee—that shouldn't be our responsibility. New airline or not, your job should be to get people from A to B as comfortably as possible. The staff service was non-existent, only coming in at the end to collect trash that it'd be impossible to have because again, no one served us anything or even offered. The plane was one of the least smooth I've ever ridden on, you could feel every slight pressure change and altitude change CONSTANTLY, and water kept dropping down from places unknown, and that I'd rather not think about. The seat belts wouldn't fit even a person of average size (I'm around 200 pounds, but not big) and that's at max extension, even the tables were shoved too close into you, but without service what use should you have for them, huh? TLDR: Don't fly Avelo, their incompetence and cheap nature is scathing and reflects how they'll treat you.

4933,Avelo Airlines,1.0,"""Overall terrible experience""",2023-01-04,True,"  I will never fly with Avelo ever again. On our way out of Kalamazoo I repeatedly received texts saying our flight was delayed further, and further. Finally made it to the airport only to have it delayed yet again. By the time we boarded the plane we were delayed at least 4 hours. Once on the plane, we were told the plane was overweight and they would be removing 13 passengers checked bags from the flight. Of course our name was one of them. Everything I needed for our trip was in the checked bag. Our only 2 options were to stay with the bag and miss our trip, (the next flight they could get us on was Friday, this happened on a Monday) or fly without our bag and they would either A. Send it on Friday with the next plane or B. Overnight it. Unfortunately it is now midnight and they have no answers for us on anything because they're customer service reps are unavailable until 8 or 9 in the morning. So we made the choice, we left our baggage behind and continue on our way. HOWEVER, at this point, another hour sitting on the plane waiting, the pilots are about to timeout. They quickly push back to get into the air, but need to de-ice first. Fine, whatever. We go to take off, the pilot aborts the first take-off attempt and we sit and wait yet again for him to figure out his problem. We FINALLY take off on the second attempt, and it is 6 hours from when we're originally supposed to take off. As for the lost baggage, we finally received our baggage that they left behind on Monday, Saturday. We reached out to customer service every day with Ridiculous hold times, told us they would call us back numerous times, but NEVER did. Finally we received an email with a lost baggage checklist, then they shipped it. Now as for on the way home. Everything went smoother this time, but we still were an hour and a half delayed.

Their prices are equal to a big carrier but in reality they are a low quality budget airline. No food or water, very uncomfortable seats that don’t recline and zero entertainment.

In addition it I took too much for luggage delivery, over an hour waiting for the first bag to deliver.

If you want to eat, there are almost no options, and guess what, you pay. That is normal on domestic flights but on international flights, unheard of. No entertainment on a 6 hour flight from Bogota to Sao Paulo. I had premium seats on one leg, selected months ago, and with an email confirmation from them. When I show up at check-in, they say there are no seats available on that class. I showed them my email confirmation, and all the lady could say is ""we are in Brazil, we have no customer service here, you have to take it up with Avianca when you get home"".

5145,Azur Air Germany,1.0,"""seats extremely uncomfortable""",2018-07-15,True," Düsseldorf to Palma. Azur Air Germany operates a fleet of two worn out Boeing 767 (25+ years old, various previous operators in Asia, Africa, South America) and a single Boeing 737-900 of formerly black listed Lion Air from Indonesia. The 767 is configured very tight. Seating is all economy in a 2-4-2 configuration. Seat pitch is the tightest I've seen on any airline and feels extremely uncomfortable, even though it was just a 2 hrs flight. They used these configuration even for flights to the Caribbean - hard to imagine this on 10 hrs flight. Passengers are mostly party tourists visiting Mallorca for drinking. Which makes sense for Azur Air's very low budget target group for their flights. Service aboard was rather poor. Drinks and meals on purchase only. They didn't provide a menu because the plane is also operating in Ukraine. Therefore all magazines were in Cyrillic and they didn't have German ones aboard. That's why it was even unclear which meals and beverages they offer. No inflight entertainment and no Wifi. Cabin crew seemed pretty new in the job and unexperienced. There were no clear procedures on board and even while boarding, creating an overall unprofessional impression of Azur Air. You could tell how Azur Air staff ""disliked"" the clientele on board. They were also rather harsh when speaking to passengers.

When I called Bahamasair, the supervisor sent us on a wild goose chase calling our credit card company and forcing us to get to the airport extremely early. The stress of not knowing if we would be able to leave the Bahamas completely ruined the end of our vacation. When we got to the airport the staff at check in could not care less.

The ground staff at Yogyakarta refused to rebook me to an earlier flight, but they kept their promises that my flight will leave before 3 in the afternoon, which is a good thing. The seat was comfortable for a 50-minute hop, and because I was assigned an emergency exit seat, more legroom is guaranteed. Crews were just okay; not rude but also not too friendly. Light meals were served for this 50-minute flight, which consisted of bread and a bottle of water. The biggest letdown was the in-flight entertainment - it used a system produced by an already bankrupt company that lacked content although it won in terms of responsiveness and layout. Their advertised Wi-Fi system did not work at all on my flight as the app kept on crashing and hanging. However, since this is only a 50-minute flight, I could not complain much.

In both cases, everything went perfectly well: there was almost no queue for checking-in and dropping my checked luggage (it's worth noting that a checked luggage is included even in the cheapest prices, BTW), the airplanes were in perfect condition (they actually looked almost new), the space for legs was OK (even during the domestic flight, it was definitely wider than in the Air Asia domestic I also took during that trip). Almost all of the cabin crew were kind and helpful (and also elegant), and during the long haul flight there was even an individual screen (which is not the case on Scoot, for instance). Also, their prices were very competitive, even when booking hardly a few days before departure. The only negative things I noticed are: - their onboard menu was very limited, both for food and for drinks. It would be great to have more choices, - they didn't offer a Wifi option (even on long haul flights).

At first, they announced that the flight will be delayed for 30 minutes, but we ended up waiting for only 10. Upon boarding the ex-Batik Air Malaysia plane, I was greeted by a somehow-cold cabin crew and a pretty hot cabin. Then, I figured out that my plane had no in-flight entertainment screens at all. I was about to be disappointed but it turned out that they offered Wi-Fi-based in-flight entertainment through the Tripper app, which was very sublime with never-seen-before options. The absence of the music selection was covered by e-magazines, vlogs, and podcast selections alongside TV shows, games, movies, and many more. Some lags still happened, but this was miles better than their old IFE system (I'm referring to the old ones installed in older A320s and 737s, not their newer PK-LU* A320s). The seat was good enough for a long flight like this. As the flight progressed, the cabin crews became even friendlier, communicative, and attentive, although they were not as friendly as on my previous Batik Air flight. They could have been friendlier by explaining the food that I had - which I assume was a delicious, nicely presented grilled chicken with sautéed beans and carrots and a chocolate muffin. Overall, for the price I paid, they impressed me in several aspects including their new Wi-Fi based in-flight entertainment, but they obviously still have several rooms for improvement.",Boeing 737-800,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Manado to Jakarta Soekarno-Hatta,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,yes,May,2022

Let's say from 10 flights with Batik Air, 2-3 were delayed, and 1-2 flights without in-flight entertainment. The seat is quite comfortable, bread & water is good enough and cabin crew service is okay.

5496,Batik Air,4.0,"""you will be disappointed""",2018-10-02,True,"  Jakarta to Singapore in business class.  The planes are new. Pilots seem reasonable competent, but service and food? Not even close. To fly from Sorong to Singapore, all on Batik, it will have taken me more than 30 hours. Plane was late in Sorong by more than one hour and then the ground staff couldn’t figure out how to speed up the passenger loading so we were another 45 minutes. We didn’t make up time in the air or in Makassar so were late to Jakarta and I missed the connection. To be fair the staff picked me up at the plane and made an effort to catch the flight, but we only had 7 minutes so it was wasted effort. We ended up at the customer service. While pleasant, no one spoke English, which was not really their fault but given they serve international customers, I would have thought English speaking was a requirement. After two hours I finally got my luggage and a car to take me to a local transit hotel, the Ibis. There are two at the airport, the Budget and Styles. They put me in styles. I would give the hotel less than 1 star. I left and paid for my own room at Ibis styles. Really, for business class, they use a very low quality hotel? They don’t even put their crew there. They were at styles! I was picked up at the hotel on time in they hotel car, as mentioned, part of Lion Group, they wanted to take me to terminal 3, which was the wrong terminal and then dropped me off at the wrong side of the terminal. Again, not a huge deal for a budget carrier, but if you think you are going to compete with Garuda, not even close. I will avoid Batik if there are other better airline options. Fortunately, today is Tuesday and my next flight is not till Saturday. I have not done a review of an airline before, but I knew little about the airline. I feel that I experienced quite a number of facets about the airline and it is clear what they can and cannot do. If you have to be somewhere or have tight connections, or expect major airline quality, you will be disappointed.

I was very disappointed with the service and the way your crew even thought about looking after the pasengers. We were being taxied out when we hit a bump and was told we had a technical problem. After sitting in the plane for just under an hour we were on the way. On the runway we went back because of technical problem. This is OK I have no problem with this, as we were unloaded and taken back to the waiting room is where your staff were shocking and I was disgusted how we were treated. You took our water when we left and when we asked for some you told us there is a shop go and buy some. Most of us only had Australian and only took credit cards. went up stairs to change but they were closed. After 2 hours I asked if we were on your plane would I be aloud to have water. After many complaints we got a little water and a couple of biscuits. After another 2 hours they take us to a hotel so after sitting there for over 5 hours they finally decided to make a decision. We waited for another hour because there were no busses. After another hour we got to the hotel which was full now we had to go to another hotel this 4 am and they were going to pick us up at 7am.

5548,Belavia,6.0,"""working to improve its position""",2017-08-16,False,"  Amsterdam to Minsk return with Belavia.  A renewed fleet and improved service seems to be the goal, but for now, beware of the inconsistencies. As of 2017, Belavia serves hot meals on all flights more than 1.5 hours. On flight to Minsk, meal of chicken, veggies and bulgur was healthy and good; on return flight, not the case at all - 95% potatoes with congealed cheese and bacon (?) with a dry muffin. So: cross fingers and hope for the best. Aircraft are very old or very new; seat comfort varies quite a bit. However, both flights were on time and staff efficient if a bit duteous, though as another reviewer has stated, the standard working presumption seems to be that everyone speaks Russian. Online check-in didn't work for unknown reason, but kiosk check-in at Amsterdam and Minsk was easy and allowed plenty of seat options. Bus-boarding in Minsk is annoying given what appear to be empty air-bridges, but it is what it is. In short, Belavia is working to improve its position and image, but inconsistency in execution remains. However, they seem to be on the right track, which is more than can be said for some of the other flagship carriers in Europe. Interesting to see where Belavia goes with the new 5-day visa-free entry in Belarus (which is hassle-less).",Embraer 90 / Boeing 737-300,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Amsterdam to Minsk,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,yes,August,2017

The airline doesn't offer online check-in and changes can't be made less than 24 hours in advance.

After being charged 50EUR last year to add my middle name on the ticket, I told myself I would never use them again. However, Blue Panorama was the only airline operating on the route I was interested in this time. Take off was scheduled at 6:30am. At 5:50am, there were still about 10 groups queuing for check-in. After checking in our luggage, we had to pay for a ""fast track service"" to skip the queue at security in order not to miss our flight. This would not have happened if the airline had planned correctly and opened more than one check-in desk. After passing through security, we found out that our flight was delayed. We were told that the tires of the aircraft needed to be changed. The airport staff said (stupidly repeating the information from Blue Panorama) that the plane would be flown to another airport to have the tires changed. However, the aircraft stayed on Bergamo airport's tarmac the whole morning. We didn't see any technician working on the wheels. We eventually took off at 11:30 (five hours delay). The crew did not even bother apologising for the delay. Is it a common situation for them. I am now trying to claim my compensation (250EUR per passenger). Blue Panorama does not have an online form to fill to ask for such compensation like most airlines. You need to send a registered letter with acknowledgement of receipt to their office Rome.

The check-in lady told us that due to a new airline rule introduced on the 17th May 2017 all passenger information has to match exactly the travel documents. Rule that turned out to be a problem for my wife: her second name was not in the booking information. For the simple reasons that: there was not such rule at the time of booking. (And no such rule on many other airlines by the way).The booking form on the airline's website does not have a field for second names. Result: 50€ to pay on the spot. With no choice really: lose the flight or pay up. Called the airline the same day and pointed out all the issues. According to Blue Panorama the new policy is a tremendous improvement, allowing the valued customer to take the flight with a little bit of extortion. I learned that the booking form still has no field for the second name but the customer is expected to input any additional names in the name field after the first one, without spaces. This is priceless. Not surprisingly, I also learnt that the only way to request a reimbursement is to send an insured letter.

It happens. Leading up to boarding, no further delay notifications were received. No communication at all. The gate agents would not talk to anyone and they weren’t even present at the desk. Extremely rude anytime someone tried to ask why they wouldn’t communicate with passengers. They very clearly didn’t work for breeze, they were probably cheap contractors that clearly didn’t give a damn about any of us. After hours and hours a gate agent finally announced on the intercom that she would provide an update to concerned travelers within a couple minutes. Hours passed by without any updates. When it was time to board they began a roll call which was very confusing and they gave no information as to why they had to do a roll call. Almost 9 hours late the flight left LAX. People on the plane were having panic attacks and no information was being provided to calm passengers down. People started asking to get off the plane and they were told they couldn’t get off even though the cabin was overheating. Finally, once at the destination Breeze just “lost” all the bags. Waited over an hour for bags. It’s not my first time flying and I know things happen but Breeze, by far, handled mistakes worse than any airline I have ever flown. Unacceptable.

Not even a magazine - which is now available by WiFi that you have to pay for. You have to pay for your seat choice, checked in baggage, food & drink, WiFi. Not that I have anything against that - I'm used to that on budget airlines - but this is for a premium price ticket. I would have preferred to fly on easyJet where the initial ticket would have been less, and the extras would have been half the price. The BA app and website makes it really difficult to understand the extras and we ended up with baggage on the wrong ticket so had to pay extra. And don't get me started on their customer service helpline. On board the staff are ok but on the long Cairo-London route they spend most of their time on a break where they use the back row or two and talk loudly without any consideration for the passengers. And for the flyers who don't want the hassle of charges, minimal cabin service, and budget seats, then they could easily provide a 'premium economy' option  and really make a difference for the experience. Heathrow Terminal 5 compounds the poor experience, especially for arrivals. It is also poorly served by transport links - especially for those of us who live near Gatwick which is being abandoned by BA. I have been a frequent flyer for many years - and was even a BA Gold Card holder at one point - so I know about the potential experience.

Worse than this, the usual atrocious boarding gate service, and boarding started 50 mins late. The flight was operated by a Finnair A320, which is barely low cost standard let alone business class. Hard, thin, uncomfortable seats, poor legroom and the cabin was simply tatty - I remain shocked that BA allow this, and it's time for BA's CEO and management focused on standards rather than bean counting. Finnair cabin staff were fundamentally courteous, but they provide a very trimmed down, budget airline type service, as the whole trip turned out to be - and yet this business class ticket was one of the more expensive on recent trips.

6089,British Airways,1.0,"""most appalling airline service""",2023-05-08,True,"  I will never travel with British Airways again. I spent over $10,000 on a business class seat to attend a funeral in the UK. First, the Boeing 787-9 cabin has 7 seats across the aisle so what you are getting in reality is premium economy. The seats are narrow and effectively are a business class seat cut in half. They have squeezed these seats in which means that some passengers bump their heads into the bulkhead when they stand up and many have to clamber over others to go to the toilet, which wakes up that passenger. The whole point about business class is that you pay to rest and have privacy and not have someone push over the top of you. Second, the food was disgusting. Third, the service terrible. Fourth, the toilet was tiny. Fifth, the inflight screen was fixed and too high so I could not see anything. Sixth, their baggage handling is also appalling meaning that my taxi was waiting for 2 hours and I had to pay more (no free airport transfers with British Airways). Seventh, the charging points did not work. The second leg to London was on a larger plane with 4 seats across the aisle. That was bearable because no hopping over people but the seat was very uncomfortable because it was not one piece. This means that you are sleeping on a metal bar (the seat) where there is a gap in the seat. To add insult to injury I now find that both flights back to Sydney are on the small plane. To book a seat before check in is $170. I paid it but note that there were only 4 seats left. This is why I got the worst seat in the house going out. This is the most appalling airline service I have ever encountered. There is no point paying for business class in British Airways.

6093,British Airways,5.0,"""premium price for very average service""",2023-04-28,False," Regarding the aircraft and seat: The business class seats on this flight were pretty good. All were of the suite type, where every seat has its own booth with sliding door for extra privacy. The downside to this is that if you are travelling as a couple, its quite difficult to interact. There is ample storage and USB charging ports. The seat is pretty comfortable. As someone who finds it very difficult to sleep on flights, this was one of the only times I've been able to get a few minutes sleep here and there. The amenities provided are pretty average when compared to other airlines. The leather toiletry bag was quite nice though. No slippers, only a pair of socks. The restrooms on the flight are very small, and don't provide much in the way of toiletries compared to other airlines. No free Wi-Fi in Business Class is not acceptable. Another example of BA's penny pinching in recent years. Regarding the staff and customer service: Poor. Inattentive. Beyond meal times there was offer of water during the flight. I had to go and find an attendant and ask. There was also no offer of any snacks. Rude at times. My partner asked for a fork to be replaced as the one provided was quite clearly dirty. The attendant was incredibly rude in response. This left us shocked. Different customers seem to receive a different quality of service. A customer behind me was repeatedly greeted politely by name and asked how they were, whether they needed anything etc. whereas my partner and I were not afforded the same level of personal service. This is disappointing as we paid the same price for the tickets so expect the same level of service. The food was pretty bad. I had risotto while my partner had chicken. Both were extremely over cooked and the rice looked like porridge. The vegetables were discoloured and flavourless. The bread was nice though. The breakfast wasn't much better. Summary: BA has become the Ryanair of long haul. The customer service is way below what I would expect for a premium airline in a premium seat. You pay a premium price for a very average service. If there are other options available I would choose them over BA these days.",Boeing 787,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Singapore to London,4.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,no,April,2023

We get to our boarding gate and again a long line with 40 minutes wait for someone to check passport and boarding pass.

The “new” club world suites are a huge step up from the old product and really on deliver comfort and privacy. The crew were professional but I personally found the food menu rather odd.

The most disappointing thing about BA is that aspects that really don’t need to get worse have. The check in staff at Heathrow are downright rude and abusive, shouting at passengers to line here and there and rolling their eyes if passengers get confused with the constant shouting and bullying. Airlines are now competing globally more and more and this behaviour is particularly noticeable in Asia where the service industry is next level. I wouldn’t want to suggest that all the staff are like this and many younger employees are polite and helpful. However there were a couple of older staff that were downright rude and obnoxious.

Sadly this trip underlines how they have slipped versus other airlines. At booking time, one is scammed an extortionate amount to book a seat. At Heathrow T5 check in the queues were unbelievably long and staff at bag drop curt to say the least. The lounges here remain awful and overcrowded and BA has not invested in them for many years. On the flight the food was okay, although portions are kept minimal. This was one of those days when the crew could not give a damn and the service was mostly absent for the entire flight.

Once on board the crew announcements were professional, relaxed and informative in typical BA style. The seat was quite comfortable. It was a refurbished aircraft and the padding and materials are quite good. I was lucky that the middle seat was empty so I didn’t suffer from the new narrow seat which I think would have made it a lot less comfortable. The IFE is excellent, responsive and good quality. There is an enormous selection of TV and movies and a good number of games. WIFI is also very good not quite Netflix quality but still reasonable and I don’t think £17.99 for full flight is bad value. You can pay less if you just want short term simple messaging. Cabin crew were very good. Friendly and efficient. Catering was reasonable although on a near 10hr flight, the small (but tasty) pastry for the second meal service wasn’t really enough. Landing and processing at Heathrow was astonishingly quick - it felt like it was 3am, even though it was 6:30pm! No queues or waiting at all. Even the baggage was super quick at coming through.

6148,Brussels Airlines,6.0,"""experience was pretty average""",2022-09-16,True,"  On July 23rd I flew with Brussels Airlines from Tel Aviv Ben Gurion Airport to Brussels. My flight experience was kind of average, my ticket costed about 600 Euros roundtrip, which was pretty expansive for an only carry-on luggage allowance ticket, but it was my fault due to late purchase of the tickets. If purchasing in advance, I could've saved 50% of the price of the tickets, which is a pretty good price considering it's not a low-cost airline, well, not exactly. I had an early morning flight, departing at approx. 05:00 AM. The flight was unofficially delayed. It wasn't announced but it did occure, it was a 30 minute delay caused by computers of the airport which shut down, not the airline's fault. We boarded rather quickly and took our seats. I found the seats to be a bit narrow. The staff on board was mostly friendly, especially one flight attendant which her name I don't remember, before take-off when I panicked a bit due to safety reasons talked to me and made me feel safe and calm. The other crew members weren't that friendly, average I would say. After take off it was asked of passengers near the window to close their window shades and let everyone sleep. So until 30 minutes before landing shades were off and everybody tried to take a nap. Fortunately I sat in an emergency isle seat (which I booked in the online check-in, for free) and had some legroom. I don't know how much legroom other passengers had but I imagine it wasn't as comfortable. Before landing a trolly passed for purchasing food and drinks. I ordered a coffee which was dull and not tasty, I think all airlines in the end serve bad coffee, don't they? Overall my experience was pretty average, not extraordinary good, or bad. I would say to sum up that Brussels Airlines is to be treated as a semi-low-cost airline. They weren't harsh on their policies, but it is nothing like a traditional airline, and it was felt. I would fly Brussels again if the fares would be attractive, otherwise I wouldn't make a special attempt to book a flight with them.",A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Tel Aviv to Brussels,3.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,yes,July,2022

Caribbean Airlines differed my ticket to a later date, at no cost. When I was ready to fly in May 2022, the call centre was able to rebook quite simply. I used the opportunity to upgrade my ticket to Business Class which the agent did over the phone, simple transaction. I use the APP for all my Flight Management with regard to seats, meal requests etc.. BW600/26JUN POS/YYZ operated on-time. It was my first time using the new B737 MAX8 and was really impressed with the comfort of the cabin. The ergonomics of the seat made for a super comfortable 6hr flight. The IFE is a big improvement on this aircraft and the aesthetic of the cabin is also very mod looking. Once of the highlights of this flight was the ability to pre-order a meal. In this case, it was the Stewed Chicken with Macaroni Pie, Callaloo, Fried Plantain. A full on Sunday lunch on a Thursday night, LOL. Food was a generous amount and very tasty. Upon arrival in YYZ, I was expecting delays exiting the aircraft and getting thru Immigration and Customs. News of lengthy delays preceded my trip, but, it was actually very easy. BW607/09JUN YYZ/POS via GEO. Another on-time departure, early in fact. I opted for this flight via GEO because I preferred a daytime flight vs the red-eye which operates non-stop YYZ/POS, no regrets. Had a nice late breakfast in the lounge at Pearson and then a another delicious pre-ordered meal as we took off towards Guyana. This time, I ordered the Curry Chicken (or Chicken Curry) with Dhal and Rice. It was also a very generous amount and very tasty. Great flight down into the Southern Caribbean.

6435,Caribbean Airlines,3.0,"""cabin was tired and dirty""",2018-02-11,True," This should have been one review as I purchased a ticket from Georgetown through to Toronto. However on arrival in Trinidad we were told we would have to deplane and change aircraft. In any other airport it would be simple. Not in Trinidad! Zero ground staff and we waited in a queue for 30 minutes and only after I asked were we advised that the boarding pass printer was down. Finally had to issue new boarding passes. Why? Then go through security again and head to the gate. I had found out my seat was changed to a window from an aisle and Trinidad gate agent said no other aisles available but on boarding I saw the emergency exit was free. He lied. Flight left 20 minutes late and Captain said it was a mechanical issue but a pax boarded at departure so was it mechanical? Seat cushion was non-existent and cabin was tired and dirty. Also greeted in Y by a nasty flight attendant who started to harangue me for putting duty free in the overhead bin as it could fall out. A simple move of the bags already there fixed that potential issue. Flight attendant watched and scowled as I sorted out the bags and solved her stacking issue. So much better to give crap to customers than fix the problem! 75 minutes after take off ""lunch"" arrives. I have never seen anything so gross in my life. Just serve nothing if this is the best you can do. No pre meal beverage service, only done at the same time as the so called ""meal"". After meal waited over an hour for pick up of the ""tray"" and no after dinner beverages offered. This was a nearly 6 hour flight! No service for 2 hours and no warning that feature movie was going to start. Of course no request to lower blinds so couldn't see tiny overhead screens anyway. They say free entertainment but no headsets provided. Bar service 90 minutes from Toronto and later the ridiculous and old fashioned warning to turn off phones and Ipads as landing soon. Hello! It doesn't matter on US or Canadian aircraft why on Caribbean Airlines? To top it off took 60 minutes for bags to arrive in Toronto.

As for the food and beverage, I think they are satisfactory, not too bad but not too tasty, the Häagen-Dazs ice cream is probably the food that I appreciated the most. The only thing that I want to criticize is that no in-flight entertainment is installed on the A320 fleet of Cathay Dragon, passengers need to download the KA Studio app in order to enjoy their in-flight entertainment. However even though I have downloaded the app in prior, it still requires me to download patches after getting on the plane, and I could not figure out how to use it, therefore the only thing I could do with the app is looking at the flight map, which is quite disappointing for such a world-class airline.",A320-200,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Hong Kong to Zhengzhou,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,yes,May,2019
6527,Cathay Dragon,3.0,"""has been downgraded""",2019-04-29,True,"  Cathay flight from Kuala Lumpur to Hong Kong, which used to operate by Cathay Pacific, has been downgraded after taken over by Cathay Dragon. The overall service was not the Cathay shall have, perhaps this is because it is still a Cathay Dragon flight, not Cathay Pacific in reality. (Is it means that we cannot anticipate the same quality of services even it was claimed under same group?) I do not sure how serious Cathay group is treating this route, maybe you have already downgrading as it is not important to you, but as a frequently flyer between these two cities and cities within China mainland, I shall not try again or recommend to my colleague or overseas partners. KA730 on 19 April, there was NO welcoming drink even a cup of water was requested twice before I was attended (water was asked 10 mins after seat belt sign was switched off which is reasonably fulfilled safety requirements). Wine is no more an option for meal, only on request and only served when asked twice for my second cup, was attended. I can strongly feel the flight attendant was not happy/willing to serve the passengers as they were leaving/walking so fast to avoid further requests.  Meal was standard, but without hot tea! I felt uncomfortable as air-con was not strong enough.  In my return flight on 26 April (KA727), it was another unpleasant experience with KA. Flight was delayed. I was informed at the HK airport, without knowing reason. I felt fine as I was too early (5pm) to be known, even when a friendly staff at the airport counter was politely asked me to check with the gate for details. I do understand there is always an unexpected or inevitable reason of flight delay, but nobody can tell us what was happened, including staff at the gate. They were not even looking at their customer who was asking for details and kept instructing me to be waited.  No answer was given, including the captain and the flight attendant manager, no apology, no info about the delay, they just treated as delay was not happened! The worst part was, when I was trying to use the headset, I found out that the plastic package was opened, and a hair was attached on it!

6534,Cathay Dragon,7.0,"""their regional project needs work""",2019-01-24,True," I've been flying Cathay Dragon for decades now (i.e. even when they were their own airline as Dragonair). They are seen as a regional carrier, and it is definitely reflected in the choice of aircraft, and the significantly less elaborate in-flight service, despite similar prices to Cathay Pacific whenever both airlines fly the same route. On my flight to Siem Reap, I was pleasantly surprised to see a significant increase in proper jet bridge boarding whenever airports offered this - a welcome change to airstairs, and it is nice that they have a ""wifi"" device IFE streaming service onboard, but like United, it annoyingly requires you to download their studio KA app, something you will have to do before boarding the plane. That being said, the selection of movies and shows onboard was decent. Seats are fine, but I found the seatback pocket somewhat crowded with their own materials (safety cards, in-flight magazines, etc.) to the point that it was difficult to fit anything inside of it. It made me think of other airlines and their shorthaul economy classes, and how they actually give a separate plastic compartment near the top of the seatback. Seeing as I haven't flown on the Cathay Dragon A320 for a while, I was pleased to see the new seats, and the fully refurbished cabins, which made the decade-old planes look new and clean, though I'd also note that the seats are narrower than they were during the Dragonair era. Food onboard is fine, but beverage service is lacking, with only coffee, tea and water as their only options - the coffee infuriatingly was bland and plasticky - it made me wonder if Cathay- one of the world's top airlines could do what most airlines have already been doing and partner up with a decent coffee chain - to name a few examples, United has Illy's, Alaska has Seattle's Best. I will continue to fly Cathay Dragon, because it's a very stable airline and one that I can count on to get me where I need to be in a timely fashion. That being said, their regional project needs work. US carriers have been catching up quite quickly, and while they'll never compete with Cathay Dragon for their routes, it likely unnerves Cathay that their cabin service is now comparable to that of North American carriers.",A320,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Hong Kong to Siem Reap,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,yes,January,2019

Breakfast with a choice of sausages with omelette and chicken with noodles. The omelette is delicious. In flight meal serving process was efficient. Cabin crew was available to serve hot beverages. Based on my observation and flying experience with Cathay Dragon, the meal portion has been resized to smaller portion since last year.

Very impressed with the seat features and spaciousness. Noise cancelling headset from J class was offered. 3 meal choices, metal cutlery, Hagan Daaz ice cream etc. Very good IFE full of movies and music. Service is good and food was delicious too. Inbound I sat in economy. A man in front of me requested to be off loaded to deal with a sudden family emergency. The crew handled it very smoothly and without fuss. It caused a slight delay, but we still managed to arrive a little ahead of time. Seat pitch in economy is very good, with 3 3 3 across. Excellent design of one tray for food, another ""tray"" under the IFE to hold drinks and media devices. USD port is nearby too. Each seat also comes with own power outlet. 2 choice of meals, also served with metal cutlery. All in all, I am honestly quite impressed with CX now.

6613,Cathay Pacific Airways,1.0,"""a huge step above the economy class seats""",2023-02-03,False,"  Hong Kong's strict quarantine procedure has been lifted and flights between Hong Kong and America are resuming gradually, so me and my family decided to fly to New York for vacation. Cathay Pacific was extremely thorough with its check-in procedures. At the beginning, all passengers will have to line up to have their body temperature checked before being able to get into one of the baggage check-in isles. I was flying premium economy and I had to stay with the economy class line. Fortunately thanks to the world class efficiency of the Cathay Pacific baggage check-in staffs, I did not have to wait too turn to have my turn. Check-in staff has kindly asked to check all my identifications and itinerary. Despite I was flying premium economy class, I was able to access and enjoy the Cathay Lounge in Hong Kong with my credit card. The lounge is simply top notch. Boarding was on schedule. There was a slight but acceptable waiting time at the taxiway due to the traffic. The flight was operated with a B777-300 with 34 seats in premium economy class configured 2x4x2. Half of the seats were occupied. On boarding I was offered a drink and asked for the specifically non-alcoholic mixed drink that Cathay Pacific always offers. In addition to that, the cabin crew also offered me a hot towel to clean up my hands before enjoying the welcome drink and all the facilities around my seat. A care kit was at each seat with a disposable mask and a few sheets of antiseptic wipes. The Cathay Pacific premium economy class seats are quite well designed to take advantage of the available space. It was surprisingly comfortable and a huge step above the economy class seats. For those who want a little more seat comfort, you should pay the extra bucks for upgrading to the premium economy seats! I have been flying Cathay Pacific for many years and I have seen the ranking of Cathay Pacific has been dropping significantly and people were talking about the deterioration of the service and cabin quality as opposed to other Asian airline counterparts. It was sad to hear because my satisfactory experience with Cathay Pacific has always been consistent and I don't notice any deterioration of the service and cabin quality. Cathay Pacific definitely deserves better. Last but not least, I recommend everyone to fly with Cathay Pacific Airways, whether long haul or short haul flight.

6635,Cathay Pacific Airways,7.0,"""deterioration of business class food and wine""",2020-09-25,True,"  While there was a direct SYD-SFO option with UA, their price for business class was excessive and my track record with UA in flight service isn't great. So I opted for the indirect SYD-HKG-SFO routing at a much more palatable price that also helped with my oneworld status. The check-in staff in SYD were great and then immigration and security were empty and I was through to airside in no time. Of course, with essentially everything closed at SYD including all the lounges, there was nothing much to do. Boarding was swift and we were on our way to HKG in no time. Security at HKG was also empty however fortunately CX's Wing lounge was open. After the mandatory additional security checks at the gate, boarding for the SFO sector was also swift. I can only say that the Cathay crew on both sectors were outstanding, much like the days of yore when Cathay was one of the world's greatest airlines. Courteous, caring and personable, they seemed to want to go the extra mile to ensure everyone was as comfortable as possible. If this review were just about the inflight crew then they'd get top marks however what drags down the experience is the continued deterioration of the CX business class food and wine offering. Most of what I consumed was average at best although the most surprising thing was that a salad that was listed both as a supper option and then again as an ""anytime"" option, only had one serving loaded for maybe 15 business class passengers. The crew were mortified but could do nothing. I realise things are tough for CX at the moment but why tantalise premium passengers with an extensive menu if you can't deliver on it? Offer me less but make sure there's enough of everything to go beyond just one passenger and I'll be happy.",A350,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Sydney to San Francisco via Hong Kong,5.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,yes,September,2020

Considering the premium seats cost almost 4 times the economy seats, I was really disappointed with the overall experience. Meal was exactly the same as what you receive in economy, as is the amenity kit. When compared to PE in Qantas or BA, this lacks a lot (you get meals and drink service more in line with business class on those carriers). The only advantage if you are a OneWorld Emerald or Sapphire is getting access to the Pier Lounge at Hong Kong Airport, otherwise if you don't have status and are looking for an upgrade other than just some extra leg room then I wouldn't recommend this. WIFI also didn't work on all 4 return legs of my flight, despite there being a WIFI symbol on the walls. You would be better off spending your money on China Southern Airlines business class seat for a similar cost (and get a lie flat seat) or paying for economy on one leg & business on the other (with any airline). TIP: Also avoid the front row aisle seats in premium - I don't really have long legs (5ft6') and yet the air hostesses still knocked my feet every time they came through the door from business, waking me up at least 4 times despite my legs not sticking out on the aisle.",A330-300,Business,Premium Economy,Brisbane to London Heathrow via Hong Kong,3.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,no,January,2020
6699,Cebu Pacific,3.0,"""a huge thanks to the crew""",2023-07-17,True," I thought I knew what I was buying, a ticket for a very reasonable price - especially with carry-on only - on a low-cost airline, so I didn't really have expectations. However, this was my first time travelling long-distance on such an airline and not the usual max. 2-hr flights. And this made a huge difference. My seat was 4J, in the front, by the window, close to the toilet, but not too close. This was all fine. But an 8+ hr long flight with 7 restrooms only, for 436 seats, probably not enough. The quality of the seats, the restrooms were so worn-off and broken that I didn't really feel comfortable (though I'm not picky at all, but the restroom was a real experience towards the end of the flight). No entertainment (TV or music), of course, seats are not too comfortable either, but at least you can order food on board. Pretty limited selection in food unless you pre-order (strongly advised), drinks, snacks...but as it happened in my case, only 2 machines to pay by card, in my case BOTH broken. No local peso with me (why, if I'm flying out), and no USD (why, if I'm European, travelling home). Since we figured this out after my order of coffee, after a little while, I was told, it was on the company, but a few hours later I was thirsty and hungry, so I asked about opportunities to get a noodle pack and water. Since they said the company likely won't allow it, the flight attendants shared their own meal pack with me (noodle pack) and I got from their water. Interesting approach from the airline, but a huge thanks to the crew. Only a question, how come nobody checked the machines before taking off? (I flew with Cebu from Saigon to Manila before, short enough flight, so on shorter distance, I would probably take them again, but I would suggest / consider other options for 3+ hr flights).",A330-300,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Manila to Dubai,3.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,yes,June,2023

6739,Cebu Pacific,2.0,"""I think Cebu Pacific doesn't even meet the basic standards""",2022-12-15,True," The Cebu Pacific website disconnects, times out, and stops loading a lot. I think they just didn't set it up to handle online traffic very well. It disrupted my booking constantly and worse, didn't process my payment properly so the booking was not confirmed, yet I was charged on my credit card. Their customer service is a Facebook chat and the staff are unfortunately not even trusted by their company with anything to do with my account so not very much help at all when I had to open a dispute on the charge since they never fixed that charge (to this day, months later and I had to book a second time, still unresolved and waiting for dispute case). The customer service help desk shouldn't be a Facebook chat - should be an actual phone line and their staff should be trained on account matters. Also their website currently is confusing with an ""old"" and ""new"" version for when you want to manage your booking. Certain options can only be done on either versions. The mobile app doesn't work at all. Always has an error. On the actual flight: the NRT>MNL plane does not have reclining seats and they do offer meals but you have to buy them. So if you are going to be hungry, eat before your board. While they were serving the snacks, I normally am okay and indifferent to the smell of instant noodles but somehow on that flight, it was just overpowering since we're in an enclosed space. After some time and just before our stomachs were going to turn inside out, thankfully the staff sprayed something in the air that eliminated the odor but I think serving such a strong smelling food is not good for flights in my opinion. The only thing I think that I can say is positive is that their check-in staff and cabin attendants were professional the entire time. I get they are a budget airline and for prices to be cheap, you compromise a lot on things but I think Cebu Pacific doesn't even meet the basic standards that other budget airlines do.

Food was very good too. On the second leg to Singapore on the A350, cabin crew was very nice too but food was average. No amenity kit for a four hour flight.

When I asked staff at SFO about this, they said “I’ll talk to my supervisor and did nothing. Just like they did when I touched down at SFO. The staff member helping me upon seeing I was upset, told me that I did it wrong. That he was at the baggage carrousel and that if I’d have gotten help it might have been different. He told me the plane was on time. (It landed on time then sat on the tarmac for ten minutes). Then no one helped me. He was exceedingly rude, and I told him if he couldn’t help me he shouldn’t have kept me waiting 30 minutes to tell me that. He flipped me off after yelling at me.

6820,China Airlines,1.0,"""It was extremely uncomfortable""",2023-04-17,True,"  I flew the business class with China Airlines from Sydney to Taipei on 3 April 2023. When I purchased the ticket in mid February, the seating plan for the business class indicated 4 seats in each row (I believe it was Airbus 350-900). I selected 14D as mv seat. A few days before departure, I received a notification from China Airlines that my seat was reassigned to 3D (no other messages than that). When I logged into the airlines' web, the new seating plan now showed each row had 6 seats. Without suspicion, I selected 4A as my new seat. When I boarded the aircraft on the day of departure, I realised that China Airlines had substituted this long haul flight with an aircraft suitable only for short haul flights. The seat space for the business class is very limited. The seat can only be laid down to about 45 degrees and there was no room for me to put my legs straight. It was extremely uncomfortable and almost impossible for sleeping (and it was an overnight flight). The supposedly complimentary wifi for the business class did not work for me (I suspect the aircraft was not equipped). The whole experience became a nightmare. I believe it is unethical and dishonest for an airline company to charge the full fares of a long haul flight and then substitute the aircraft with a short haul one, without seeking an agreement from the customers or any compensation. I would have been better off to take the economy class, at least saving myself an extra A$3500 (I paid over A$4800 for round trip).",Airbus 330-300,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Sydney to Taipei,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,April,2023
6823,China Airlines,2.0,"""experience was awful from the start""",2023-03-31,False,"  The experience I had with China Airlines was awful from the start. It began at check in when I saw a China Airlines employee holding a sign that said CI005. My booking said CI 007 so I figured I was close to where I needed to be. The China Airlines employee then directed me to the opposite side of the terminal. After walking over there I discovered there was no check in for China airlines. As it turns out the line I needed was directly adjacent to the man that directed me to the other side of the terminal. Didn’t even know his own Airlines check in location. After waiting in line for twenty minutes with no movement, they finally started checking in passengers (since when are check in counters closed). Once the check in line started to move, they processed one about every five minutes. All the while the premium class ticket check in line was empty and those attendants just sitting doing nothing. You would think if they had no premium passengers to check in they would help the economy line no talking with coworkers was clearly more important. Once I finally arrived at the counter, I was told my carryon wouldn’t have to be checked due to weight 8Kg (my backpack was heavier but that was OK for some reason).",Boeing 777,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Taipei,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,no,March,2023

On the contrary the proactive mid-flight runs to keep passengers hydrated (trays with water and orange juice) weren’t many. Unproblematic transfer in Taipei for the onward journey to Jakarta.

I departed at 05:45 p.m., and meals were served 3 times, 1 dinner in the connecting flight from HCMC to Taipei and 2 on the flight from Taipei to Frankfurt. The food was good, but there were not many options and the menu was the same for both departing and returning flights. The crew were friendly and caring, they noticed when I felt uncomfortable due to low temperature inside the cabin and offered hot drinks. The seat was comfortable. I'm a rather small girl (162cm in height), so I had no problem with legroom, but it might have been a bit cramped for some other passengers around me. My returning date was a busy day for Frankfurt airport, so I had a delayed takeoff, which made me miss my connecting flight from Taipei to HCMC. I had a long delay at Taoyuan airport. The airlines handled the situation well, they offered me to stay in their lounge and took care of my baggage, coupons for food and bevarage were also given.

They gave us a transfer sleeve to store boarding passes for later segment, which was a nice touch. We had a remote gate far away and had to be shuttled by bus. That experience wasn't very pleasant as we had to wait inside the bus for a very long time. Despite having reservation for four seats (traveling as a family), there was no available overhead storage. All four of us had requested special meals, but the flight attendants started serving us regular meal. It was only after we showed them our boarding passes that they served our special meals. The overall ambiance, seating comfort, and IFE were excellent. Both B777-300ER and A330-300 were tastefully decorated. The service between Taipei and Bali segment was far superior to what we experience between LA and Taipei. The service on our final segment from TPE to LAX fell below the mark. The flight attendants serving us in economy didn't smile and were quite rude while interacting with us. So, while friendly service was absent in TPE-LAX segment, the WiFi worked well on B777-300ER.

The crew on all my flights were friendly, professional and very safety conscious. Meal service was prompt and with a smile, and the crew were polite and friendly. I ordered several drinks and requested a toothbrush and an adapter and all were delivered quickly. They passed out hot towels for economy class passengers which is a much-appreciated gesture. During the overnight flight staff often passed through the cabin with water and juice, and kept the toilets clean. My flight back to Melbourne was delayed by 8 hours and we were provided accommodation at the Novotel near Taipei airport and they organised a shuttle bus to take us back to the airport in the morning, I found the ground staff at Taipei airport to be friendly and customer focused. The onboard entertainment system is easy to navigate and had many new releases and TV shows to choose from. The only aspect that could be improved is their food options, I found most of my meals to be lacking flavor, however they did offer an ice cream bar and a bread roll with all meals.

The seats are sturdy, so you can't feel movement by other passengers in neighboring seats getting up and down. Amenities are decent, and the cabin staff is attentive. Overall, though, this is at best a middling business-class product. Unlike other airlines, you don't get Champagne before departure, just a choice of apple juice, orange juice, or water. In-flight entertainment options are quite limited, with many movies and TV shows available only in Chinese. The food tends to be merely edible, and seldom appetizing or enjoyable. It's beyond me why they charge business class passengers for WiFi - there's nothing like paying upwards of $5000 for a single ticket, trying to log on to WiFi, and finding that you need to pay extra for WiFi access. As for ground service, China Airlines lounges are notoriously bleak. They're often quite crowded, and the food and beverage choices are ridiculously limited. (In Taipei, for example, they have 4-5 dim sum varieties on offer, some congee, and a couple of other Chinese offerings, such as a cabbage stir-fry dish. At the SFO lounge, the choices are vastly more limited. You'll get far better food outside in the terminal.)

Food was good and plenty, the entertainment was good with many choices. I tested the onboard WLan which was alright, but not really needed.

The distance between the seats is large enough, and the seats can be adjusted at a large angle. The seats are quite spacious, very good. The bathroom is clean.

For the food I can't give any comments as neither I nor my wife have tried it but I found it very funny that they serve breakfast at afternoon time in Shanghai. Drink selection was also not so nice, just standard soft drinks, Chinese Qingdao beer or Chinese red wine. The aircraft was pretty new however for the seats I had the feeling that they are really old.

Food was on par with US international long haul in business, but did notice the crew tended to not give the non-Chinese passengers the Chinese snack option. After the second flight I realized this and ordered the Wonton Soup as my snack on the remaining two. The seats where fine, again on par with standard long haul business even if the cabin was a bit warm. Couldn't figure out how to get the WiFi to work and yes we did register prior to boarding with their app. We did the 144-hour transit Visa and spent a couple days in Shanghai before heading to Male. Was laid out in easy to follow signage. On the return we did a longer layover and the Lounge in the new terminal was good. It did tend to get crowded in waves over the course of our 6 hours there.

6975,China Eastern Airlines,2.0,"""most unprofessional experience""",2019-03-25,False,"  Paris to Sydney via Shanghai. By far, the rudest and most unprofessional experience I have ever encountered with airline and customs staff! I used the bathroom when we boarded the plane, only to find that the toilet was dirty and there was no hand soap to use! This was before take-off on an 10-12 hour international flight. The staff were extremely rude and unhelpful. I have no idea how or why they are even in this industry at all. When my partner politely asked for a glass of water, the air hostess rolled her eyes at him, let out a huge sigh and pulled a face like it was the most inconvenient thing to be asked. Another hostess had an almost identical reaction when a woman asked for another blanket. The food was reminiscent of the really old, bad airline food of yesteryear. Also, the food was very few and far between. We went 8 hours without food at one stage. I asked for a snack at this point, & was told there were no snacks or anything to offer. Before the first trolley run of drinks even reached our row, all wine and beer on the plane had ran out. This was less than 1 hour into a 10-12 hour international flight. How can they run out of beer & wine?? When I asked this, the hostess held up 1 single bottle of red wine & said “it’s gone” and then kept pushing the trolley by us. We were shocked. The earphones provided allow zero sound to come through from the movie, so we didn’t end up watching anything at all, because it was impossible to hear any sound. The airport staff at customs were extremely rude and unhelpful also. When I tried to ask questions, I was ignored. My partner had to get angry and insistent before anyone would Listen or assist us.

It was 6"" bun with 2"" x 2"" of bologna. It was all dry bread. Their idea of a sandwich is a small loaf of dry bread. Not one of the in-flight crew were polite or smiled.

The flights left on-time and arrived early, the cabins were clean on both flights. However, I didn't like the 10 abreast configuration of a 777, which is very cramped. Secondly, I found it very poor for an airline like this to run out of beer 2 hours into a 14 hour flight. The cabin crew aren't particularly attentive or focused. The food wasn't great for an international airline. The entertainment provided limited options of music, TV and films. Finally, the airline advertises free wifi, but it almost never works, which was disappointing. Overall, while not a disastrous experience, China Eastern is way behind competitors like Emirates, KLM, Qatar, Singapore Airlines, Garuda and Cathay Pacific in terms of its service standards.",Boeing 777,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Shanghai to New York,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,no,February,2019

Customer service Both customer service office in Melbourne and Sydney office were very helpful. Please note that the Melbourne office is only contactable by email (never answers the phone) If you want to speak to someone call the Sydney office. Crew Very professional in all flights. Thank you to them for making our flight an enjoyable experience.  Time Keeping: all four were flights arrived on time, very unusual in my experience. PVG Terminal 1 Departures/Transit Depending on your ticket class, the airline offers a dining voucher (selected places) when having a long stop over in PVG, 80RMBpp. This is enough to get you a decent bowl of noodles each at Hope Star Coffee & Cafe. The info is on their website but difficult to find. See below for more transiting info. Check In - PVG Many check-in desks open, very quick and painless. CONS Food Poor, even coming out of Shanghai. Turbulence: At the first sign of turbulence the seat belt sign lights up and then stays on for the entire flight. This happened on all four flights. Everyone ends up ignoring it as a result. Website Hard to navigate and makes many errors Online Check In Pointless both in London and Shanghai, no bag drop for online check in (Only MEL). Check In - LHR Very few check in desks open, 1 hour to check-in. Boarding Passes When checking in online it asks you to print your boarding passes (no point as they print it for you at the airport). Our computer could not find the font to print the boarding passes. Another occasion, the website did not recognise our check-in. PVG Terminal 1 Arrivals: cash machine did not work on our arrival. If this is the case you need to walk to terminal 2 to withdraw cash. PVG Terminal 1 Departures/Transit Shops are generally quite poor and expensive and so to are the nearly all the restaurants. One cafe that stands out is Hope Star Coffee & Cafe, serves decent food nicely presented, by far the best place to eat in Terminal 1. There is also two Starbucks, one at each end of the terminal, one has seats inside the other just takeaway. Depending on your ticket class or your time of stopover you could instead choose a maglev pass or a hotel room for a number of hours over the dining voucher. But the airline said we could not leave the airport with a 7hr stopover. When waiting to go through immigration and number of people we told they could not enter on their transit and we directed through to the transit area. If you’re looking to stopover for a couple of days you can get a 144hr visa on arrival at no charge. This also allows you to visit selected provinces. The Bullet train makes it possible to do this. We visited friends in Nanjing, on our return leg to Shanghai the train took 1hr 11mins to travel 290km, costing around $35AUD one way.",Boeing 777-300,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Melbourne to London via Shanghai,4.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,yes,December,2018
6999,China Eastern Airlines,8.0,"""all pleasant throughout""",2018-11-14,True,"  Honolulu to Hong Kong via Shanghai. My wife and I took a chance on our last trip to Asia and flew on China Eastern Airlines. The fare for the flights we chose on them were a few hundred dollars lower than what we were finding on more traditional Asian carriers. We booked our ticket through a third party platform (Justfly) in early October for a November 1 departure from Honolulu to Hong Kong via Shanghai. One thing that you will find out quick is that when you book your ticket through a third party, you are not able to then go back to the airlines website and check on the booking until the day before departure. You also cannot choose seats until, literally, you get to the airport and check in at the kiosk. This made us wonder if the booking ever happened. I even worked with Justfly to confirm and looked at my Credit Card bill in which China Eastern was indeed paid the money for the booking we made. So as far as I was concerned, on the day we left, there would be a booking. On that day, we went to the airport just a little earlier than normal to be sure that if there were any problems whatsoever, we could deal with them in time for the flight. What pleased me was that the booking was indeed in the system, our seats chosen and we could even change our seats right there. Another concern I had from reviews on this and other sites said that the bags would not be checked through to our final destination, meaning that when we got to Shanghai we would need to exit the airport, get our bags and re-check them into our Hong Kong flight. We were pleased that this was not the case and indeed, the bags were tagged for Hong Kong and, indeed, hours later upon arrival we saw our bags on the carousel there. Service on the flight was good. Coach class food that was served was perfectly fine. They did serve red wine on the flight and we enjoyed a variety of good food throughout the service to Shanghai, and then to Hong Kong. Keep in mind that the most safe food that one can eat is the food that is served on an airplane, so unless you are allergic to some ingredient that they use, you will find the food quite applicable and satisfactory. Later on when I was walking the cabin I noted a small bar in the galley that one could get a drink and a bag of peanuts. Aircraft was clean and seemed neatly taken care of, One thing that a passenger of a healthy girth may need to know is that the seat belts don't make it all the way. You will need to ask for a extender, which the crew happily gives upon request. The attendants spoke English as well as Chinese, and were all pleasant throughout the service we experienced. With more ""effervescent"" passengers, they still acted professional and held to standards at all times. The entertainment system at each seat had a decent variety of movies and the flight tracking program was as good as ones I have seen on American or Delta. Transfers at Shanghai for passengers going on another China Southern or Shanghai Airlines flight (the airlines are one in the same with Shanghai being the more ""basic transportation"" airline) are very straightforward, Just follow the signs to the transfer desk and go through security. Be sure to take out any electronic devices including power chargers for your phone - have them go through the X-ray without pulling out and most likely the security people will take the device from you with some excuse saying that it was too large or not applicable.",A330-300 / A321-200,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Honolulu to Hong Kong via Shanghai ,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,yes,November,2018
7003,China Eastern Airlines,2.0,"""seats were way too small""",2018-10-22,True,"  Vancouver to Phuket via Nanjing. We purchased our return tickets to Phuket from Vancouver for only $679 which was the only bright side of this flight. Our flight from Vancouver to Nanjing was cramped and the seats were way too small for two adult men who are 5'10 and 6'2. The service was efficient but the food, drinks (lack of wine) and in-flight entertainment were worse than the 4 other Asian airlines I have flow trans-Pacific. When we arrived at Nanjing for our connecting flight there was no international transfer area so we had to clear immigration and re-check in for the Nanjing to Phuket flight which was a horrendous experience: after an hour long wait for immigration, we were sent to a small transfer seating area to wait for another hour until a China Eastern agent arrived to escort us, along with a group of about 20, downstairs to the baggage claim to collect our luggage and then escorted back upstairs to the departures area to check-in which took another hour. We were then escorted to the departures immigration desks at which point we were finally given back out passports and released into the terminal. So instead of simply entering an international transfer area and relaxing until our next flight we were sent on a 3 hour goose chase all around the airport, including 3 separate immigration counters, without our passports and virtually no communication about what was happening. Some of the other transferring passengers were in tears. The Nanjing to Phuket flight was better but we were not given an arrivals card and when I asked the flight crew for one they said they didn't have any. So we proceeded into Phuket immigration clearance area and searched for arrivals cards to no avail. We then entered the immigration line and waited an hour only to be told to go back and get an arrivals card from our airline. There were no China Eastern staff anywhere so we ended up asking Thai airlines for assistance and finally received an arrivals card to clear immigration. Sorry, China Eastern, but there are way too many better options to ever waste our time with this airline again. In the future I will avoid transferring through China at all costs.",A330-200,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Vancouver to Phuket via Nanjing,2.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,no,October,2018
7015,China Southern Airlines,7.0,"""seat, plane and amenities are super clean""",2023-07-08,True," Despite 11 hr GZ-AKL flight time, the whole experience felt only 4 or 5 hours thanks to excellent sleep made possible by 180 degrees lie-flat seat. The seat strangely enough isn't comfy when it's in recliner mode, much better in normal seating mode with leg rest/lumbar support adjustments. The message function is awesome. However, the seat design isn't really for storage of bags/shoes. The spaciousness of the seat is more for writing and putting many dishes/items etc. Nevertheless space is plenty in overhead locker. The CZ business class experience isn't designed for people who want luxurious/special flight experiences. It's more for passengers who want good products, great (Chinese) food and things that just work. The seat, plane and amenities are super clean. The punctuality is outstanding. The service is more on the practical and task-completing sides than those of Emirates/Singapore/Qatar airlines. Great attendance, efforts and politeness. Despite not being fluent in English the crew are very hard-working and proactive in helping people.

It took me too long time on check-in waiting line before departure. There is no notice board what passenger need to prepare for check in, except a reminder of China Customs Health Declaration Form. After 20-30 mins waiting, I came to check in counter and show every document requested to ground crew of airline (IPA-VISA, vaccination report, Covid-19 test results report, international travel health certificate, and SG airport PCR test reservation). Everything was fine except my COVID-19 test report, that was written by both English and Chinese and provided by formal hospital of Liaoning. However, it was refused as informal certificate. Then I showed my International Travel Health Certificate which was also not recognized as valid document. The clock went to 11:20 that time and ground crew requested me to ask a new COVID-19 report from hospital and find a printer to print every document out. The scene was a mess disaster that time. The time is tight, I was not informed the priority of doing all these things and i was unclear would those document use for boarding the airplane or enter SG customs. is that necessary to print all these out? At the final time, ground crew gave me a Declaimer Form to sign then they can allow me to board. I didn‘t print documents for tight time. My new COVID-19 test report (as requested it has my passport number and date of birth) came to me when I was on the flight before I arrived SG.

7179,CityJet,1.0,"""still not received my bag""",2018-07-18,True,"  London City to Florence. I am utterly appalled by this airline. Not only were we diverted mid-flight from Florence to Pisa because of a technical fault (we were delayed in take off also by a technical fault - unclear if it was the same one, but the aircraft was rather old and shabby, and the toilet stunk to high heaven). Most egregiously, about 20 passengers did not have their bags loaded on to the aircraft. I received no information or apology from the airline about this. Some passengers seemed to have received a text letting them know of the issue, with a brief apology and no explanation. We were provided with a bus to Florence Airport where we were told to file a baggage claim (since CityJet do not operate out of Pisa), but there was no-one in charge of directing us - it was up to passenger initiative to figure out all steps. Once at Florence Airport we were offloaded and sent on a Kafkaesque quest from office to office, into the bowels of the airport, across the tarmac, and into the arrivals hall to finally file the baggage claim. Had I not actively engaged fellow passengers I would have never figured out any of these procedures. This was on Sunday, 15th July, 2018.

As it was booked through my company, you can't use the Condor App, web page, or Condor phone customer service to help you in anyway if you have an issue. Even when the booking company called Condor directly, which Condor said was the only way changes or seat selection could be made, Condor still said no.  I booked Premium Economy and then paid $50 on my personal credit card for my seat. The ticket itself was paid for by my company, I had to pay for the seat with my personal credit card. Then, 3 days before the flight, Condor changed planes and the new plane didn't have Premium Economy. Not sold out, but the new plane didn't have those seats at all and no refund for the $50 for my seat selection. My wife was traveling with me, she purchased her ticket directly from Condor, and no seat even though she paid $50 as well. My wife is vegan and selected a vegan meal. But  we are now on the plane in economy, and no vegan meal for her. She is allergic to dairy so her Vegan meal is not a choice, but a medical condition. Her ticket says Vegan meal, when she signs on to the app it says Vegan Meal, but when the Attendant looks at her list, there is no Vegan Meal.

Economy is the absolute smallest seat I have even flown. We flew on KLM's Cityhopper later on our trip which is an Embraer 190. Tiny plane with only 2 rows on each side. We had more legroom on a commuter plane than on Condor Economy. Inches more. I am 5 ft 11 inches and I have shared a photo of the legroom on Condor. My knees touched the back of the seat in front of me.  Condor refunds us the difference between Premium Economy and Economy. But not for the seat selection.  So, we are out $100. About the only positive thing I can say is they didn't lose our checked bags. Really low bar. Just don't. Just don't fly Condor.

When boarding the aircraft, instead of greeting the passengers and helping out with storing luggage, two of the crew members in the economy were engaged in personal discussions, not even acknowledging passengers. During the landing, they did not notice that some passengers did not have seats in the mandated upright position. The food quality is average, and you have no choice in terms of the meals you get. Also, they don't provide enough drinks, and you need to constantly go to the back and ask for more. They don't provide bottles of water, only small cups. Economy seats have very limited legroom and are not very comfortable. On the one hand, you get slightly lower prices than Lufthansa and have the advantage of flying directly; on the other hand, the service on board is disappointing.

7397,Condor Airlines,4.0,"""I would be better off in cargo""",2022-10-06,False," I've flown Condor long haul twice a year for 15 years. Premium economy has always been a good value compared to other airlines. However, I know that all airlines are still hurting after the COVID pandemic and with my next trip in about a month I've had the most terrible time ever with any airline getting a really basic and simple booking revision completed. Total time on the phone was around 6 hours over a three day period. If you can get them to answer a phone you are fortunate, and if you can understand their English your hearing is much better than mine. In spite of the language being very difficult to understand, during three of my six calls, I've concluded that those three that I'd spoke with just did not know what they were doing. This goes for a lot of their ground crew on their seasonal routes I suppose because they are part time and being trained in a short period. In one instance the counter person attached my bag claim sticker to my luggage, I pointed it out and he apologized. It's obvious they need to sharpen their skills. The only thing I can say is that they got me to where I was going, and was fed well. As far as comfort? I would be better off in cargo. But no denying they are the cheapest. I don't want to run an airline, but would suggest they increase their fares by 20-25% and provide less seating with more space. They would still be about 15% less than most of their competition.",Boeing 767,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Seattle to Frankfurt,1.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,no,May,2022
7402,Condor Airlines,1.0,"""lied to about the seating""",2022-09-12,True,"  We booked a pair of business class seats for my wife and myself roughly nine months prior, and checked in online several hours before the flight. Once at the airport (FRA) we proceeded to the check in counter where they took our luggage. After it disappeared down the belt, we were told to talk to another agent. Due to a sudden aircraft change the flight had no business class seating, and consisted of economy only. However, we would be given a row (3 pax) each. This is regrettable but normal. However, on asking to cancel our tickets, we were told we would not receive any refund and would not be rebooked - they also have our luggage at this point. Not wanting to miss our next connection, we decided to move forward and board the aircraft. We immediately noticed the 12 business class seats that did indeed exist. Even further, no seats were blocked (the 3 pax did not exist). This was standard economy seating. We asked a flight attendant what was going on. We were obviously shocked. Surrounded by an entire cabin of passengers being lied to about the seating, it turn bad quickly. The gate pulled away and we were trapped on the aircraft. For the next two hours we sat, unable to exit with no explanation. The cabin began heckling the crew as they continued to lie about the departure time without rationale. Finally we saw the issue, they were waiting for cargo to arrive and load. Clearly the passengers were the second priority. Once in the air a woman started projectile vomiting. Instead of helping the poor girl, the flight attendants ran around screaming. After about 15 minutes I was about to get up and help this poor girl to the bathroom when one of the other flight attendants finally intervened and did so. We finally talked to yet another flight attendant about this whole situation. She said ""what can I do about it?"" and that asking her to do so was cruel. Upon landing, to no surprise at this point, we sat another hour on the tarmac.  An elderly gentleman sitting behind us asked repeatedly asked for wheelchair because he could barely walk. He was ensured over and over he would have one. As we climbed down the stairway, I helped carry his bag and across the tarmac to the busses. No chair in sight. Everyone still in shock.

7409,Condor Airlines,3.0,"""One of the worst airlines""",2022-07-29,True,"  One of the worst airlines I have ever flown with. Online check-in was not working for some reason, it didn't accept my covid vaccine, even though I tried with 3 different documents, all of them being valid and accepted later in-person. This meant that I can't have my boarding pass, so I had to wait 1 hour in line to do an in-person check in. There I found out that since I have an economy light ticket I cannot have a carry-on luggage, only a personal item. This is quite outrageous on a transatlantic flight, but the worst thing was that this was not clearly highlighted in the confirmation email (it only said that I don't have any checked-in baggage but it didn't say anything about carry-on). Therefore, I had to pay 50 euros for my carry-on luggage, but the real issue was with the communication and tone of the check-in lady. She was quite agitated and not kind by any means. The most ridiculous thing is the 9 euro in-flight premium entertainment package. My return ticket was $1100, therefore 9 euros are practically nothing compared to this. If the ticket would have been $1120, I would have still bought it, but at least I would have had a decent experience. This form of ridiculous penny pinching leads to no-one using the screens in the back of the seats, so it's totally unnecessary to have them. Food was low quality and not enough in quantity. Seat comfort was terrible, I am quite an average sized human but could barely fit in the seat and it was very far away from comfortable, especially for a 11 hour flight.",Boeing 767-300,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Phoenix,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,July,2022

7475,Copa Airlines,2.0,"""makes such fundamental mistakes""",2022-12-05,True," My family group of six passengers was booked to fly IAD-PTY-POS and return Nov 19 to Nov 27, 2022. I've flown COPA before with decent experiences. Our outbound flight departed on time, but experienced mechanical difficulties on the tarmac and returned to the terminal. Outbound flight was then cancelled. After a ridiculously long wait because only one staff member seemed to be available to rebook, we were rebooked on a United flight to Trinidad the following day. Annoying, but I understand mechanical difficulties and the need to be cautious about them. After our arrival in Trinidad, we heard nothing for a week. Ominously, there was no reminder to check in 24 hours before departure. The website said to call Copa so we did, only to find that our booking but not the flight had been cancelled. Seems that COPA's IT system is too incompetent to understand that a passenger rerouted on another airline because of a COPA failure has arrived at destination. We were offered miserable options. 2 people could go on the scheduled flight, but the remaining four would have to wait for a day. Later that day, it became clear from Kayak that more seats were available on our original flight at 4am the following morning. I called to request that all of us be put on our original flight. The representative insisted that any change to our original flights would require a change fee of $75 per person. And, in the end, he claimed there were no seats anyway. To deal with this, my entire party of six (including a five and a seven year old) went to the airport at POS at Midnight for the 4am flight. We were put at the bottom of the standby priority list (which COPA said didn't exist/wasn't available) and were given the last seats, after many other standbys had been given seats. We had to run to get the flight. What sort of an airline cancels your booking because its system is so incompetent that it doesn't recognize that you flew outbound on the flight it booked for you after it cancelled your outbound flight? And then cancels your return booking? And then demands $75 per person to get back onto the flights it had cancelled in error from under your feet? Such a waste as other important things, like plane quality and service were OK.

7485,Copa Airlines,1.0,"""absolutely shameful and disgraceful""",2022-10-24,True,"  I'll start by saying I really want to like Copa. The staff is really friendly at airports and on board, and they have a wonderful new terminal at PTY now operational. Unfortunately Copa has a unique ability to fail to think through their processes related to the new terminal and completely ruin the passenger experience as a result. They've completely snatched defeat from the jaws of victory, and my experience which I'll relay here is nothing short of Orwellian and bizarre. Having had several subpar experiences at the old terminal (T1), I was really looking forward to using the new terminal (T2) on this trip PTY-MDE-PTY. The outbound flight from PTY was a wonderful opportunity to experience it - the terminal is spacious, clean, modern and efficient - everything that the old terminal isn't. Everything worked well from check in to security, passport control and boarding and I was impressed. All Copa flights depart from the new terminal and everything functioned well. I should've cautioned my enthusiasm after my departure experience as I had no idea what awaited me on my return. On the MDE-PTY return for some odd reason that nobody could explain the Copa arrivals came into the old terminal, which struck me as odd. Why would you build a beautiful new terminal and not use it for all of your flights. Be that as it may, the flight arrived at the old terminal, and I went down to passport control and got through quickly but when I wound up in baggage claim to collect my bag I was astounded to hear that the Copa bags are all delivered to the new terminal. So there I was through passport control and in baggage claim and learned I was in the wrong place. I had to exit baggage claim, make my way to the new terminal via a severely under air-conditioned bus or walk in 30 degree heat and rain. I finally got to T2 but because the baggage claim area is secure, it was not possible to freely enter to collect my bag. Airport personnel insisted I solicit help from Copa to get me inside to get my bag. I spoke with about 6 different Copa employees and spent approximately 30 minutes gaining access. The Copa employees were helpful but not terribly sympathetic. They told me it was totally my fault (blame the customer) that I didn't know the bags were to be delivered and collected at T2 despite a T1 arrival. In my defense I heard no announcement on board, was sent no notification via email or text, was told nothing about this when I checked in for the flight, was given no piece of paper that explained this in Spanish or English, there were no Copa employees who met the plane at the old terminal to advise us to stay airside to go to T2 to collect our bags, and nobody in passport control or baggage claim to explain, no screens advising. In short there was no communication on behalf of the airline to assist passengers. Logically any passenger who arrives in one terminal would expect their bag to arrive in the same terminal. This logic was completely lost on all airport and airline personnel as I tried to collect my bag. I simply cannot understand nor accept that the airline and airport are not at fault by choosing to build a new terminal then not use it, force passengers to walk 1 km in the heat to collect their bags at another terminal and then implementing a a scheme that provides zero information about this to passengers at any stage in the process.

I tried to give her some trash to throw away, but she just told me to leave it in the seat pocket. Classy. The breakfast on the way to PTY was pretty bad, but the dinner on the way to ORD was good. The inflight wifi didn't work on either of the two long flights to and from ORD. None of the planes had power outlets. The flight from PTY to MDE (inbound aircraft from YUL) had new business class seats that were further apart, however all the other planes had standard business class seats that would not be good for an overnight flight.

First, they are nearly impossible to get ahold of and their website is horrible to navigate. We paid for business class for the longer portion of our two flights, and somehow it was attached to our shorter flight. No one was able to be reached to explain what changes needed to happen. So instead of being comfortable and able to sleep on a very long flight, I was crammed into a middle seat next to a man who took up his seat and half of mine and would not stop moving around. They also were late in almost every way. The check in counter in Punta Cana was empty and travelers were frantic. They arrived late to each location and took in excess of one hour unloading baggage on each stop. We only made our connecting flights because we boarded the exact same plane we came in on. If you’re using them for a connection with a short layover you’re likely to miss your flight. Upon arrival in San Francisco my bag was missing and the staff was incredibly dismissive. When I described the items in my bag she wrote out a ticket for 3 items inside the bag that can identify it as mine. She wrote out “fire stars” instead of “cigars”.

The flight was on time, there was also an inflight wifi, which worked well. Crew was polite, nice and attentive, only water was given for free, but that's normal nowadays. However, Czech Airlines offer so called ""Gourmet menu"" for 14€, which must be purchased online at least one day before take-off. For that 14€ you get a tasty hot meal served on porcelain, dessert, salad, fresh buns with butter and three drinks including wine/beer and hot drinks, served in glass or porcelain cups. All that with maximum willingness and professionalism. To conclude, give this airline with almost 100 years of tradition a chance.

This airline is facing as a traditional and modern one. But reality becomes when I saw the type of aircraft, I realize, that I will fly with low-cost airline aircraft. I believed that for price 210€ I'll get the full experience of the traditional airline. I prepaid food and seat in the first row. About one week later, when I wanted to add baggage, my booking manager site was empty (no option to add more services). So I called the customer centre and I got information that this is happening often and it's not possible to fix my booking manager and I have to manage everything via call centre (the mobile app is useless, you can't manage anything there - you only see information about the flight). Then the operator also told me that my seat (i paid for the first row) was changed because of changing aircraft. I wasn't noticed before via mail or SMS, that this happened. Not for least, she also told me, that this aircraft doesn't have""kitchen, so it's not possible to have warm food there, which I paid for. So I ask for another baggage and refund for food. One week later I tried to have another call and ask about my issue. Another operator told me, that it is possible to have warm food on this flight. I was totally disappointed, but at the and I order a paid for the food again with hope, that second operator knows what she speaks about. During boarding, I came to the oldest plane I can imagine from the most low-cost airline Smartwings. Legroom was tiny as in other B737, but my seat was priced as the extra-legroom seat.

Flight from Prague has been codeshare with CSA but operated by Smartwings. Much to my surprise, CSA rejected to check my luggage through to the final destination, saying that they do not have the respective arrangement with KLM. Both companies are SkyTeam members and my flight has been presented as KLM flight. Consequently, I have been forced to pick up my luggage in Amsterdam, leave the terminal, check-in again, pass security and passport control. Rather than having my planned meeting in Amsterdam, I had to deal with my luggage. I was checking with KLM and they confirmed, that there is indeed no agreement between these two companies and CSA is right. And it is despite the fact, that flight has been marketed and sold as KLM flight. Another problem is, that you purchase a ticket with 4-star airlines to end up with poor quality 2-star low-cost, which does not even let you choose your seat for free (despite my Elite Plus status).

8040,Delta Air Lines,8.0,"""Overall the flight was good""",2023-05-03,False,"  April 5th we travelled from Sydney to Mexico City and Cabo to Sydney on April 25th, 2023. We booked premium economy after looking at reviews. I've travelled Premium economy with Air Canada once previously. Sydney to LA was very comfortable with the foot rest and ample room. The seats go back far enough for me to sleep quite well. We received a menu and could choose from 2-3 options at dinner and breakfast. There were different wines to choose from as well. Food was great and it was so nice to eat off plates with proper cutlery and not be knocking elbows. The flights from LA to Mexico City and Cabo to LA were also great. What we didn't realise that because we had booked Premium Economy on our main legs we were in comfort class on the shorter flights. More room, designated cabin storage and choice of snacks. So that was a nice surprise. On our return flight from LA to Sydney there was a marked difference in the quality and choice of food and wine. We had a two choices for main one being vegetarian and no choice for breakfast. The dessert was a small slice. I asked for some fruit but none as forthcoming until breakfast. There was only one white wine offered that being Chardonnay which I don't like. Delta advertises wine and food choices for premium economy and did not deliver on the LA to Sydney leg. We did get noise cancelling headphones to use which was good but just be aware you cant use them with your devices only the entertainment provided so you still may want to bring your own. Also internet did not work LA to Sydney but did Sydney to LA. The amenity bags from LA to Sydney included out of date lotions and vouchers. No access to the lounge which United does include in its premium economy offers. Our return flight was changed to a 7 hour wait in LA so it would have been nice to have had lounge access for something that was not our fault. The Sydney to LA flight was late leaving and we had a 2 hour window to collect our bags , recheck them and get to another terminal to catch our flight to Mexico City. Luckily customs was quick but the baggage carousel stopped and needed a maintenance person. It didn't look like we were going to make it. I know Delta would have to book us onto the next available flight if we missed our flight due to no fault of our own but that does create booking problems. As we ran to the gate the boarding closed sign was up but previous passengers had told them we were on our way and we were able to board. Just! There was no allowance or help given by Delta for something they were responsible for. In hindsight a 2 hour time frame does not take into account any delays so a 3 hour window would be much less stressful or stay overnight in LA. Overall the flight was good, especially Sydney to LA. As we have gotten older we have decided to travel in more comfort and Premium Economy does supply that.

A glorified bus ride. What’s more upsetting is the whole “going green” charade to cut cost on elements that are so fundamental to the passenger such as food. They provide meals with this sort of pre-packaged configuration where you get useless wood silverware that makes eating completely difficult. Lack of trays makes eating a super annoying task. The portions are a joke for a 10 hours flight, and breakfast is just replica of the American “beef pockets”.

Food was fairly acceptable but was nothing compared to Cathay Pacific. Fortunately the cabin crew were friendly and courteous, making this flight a fairly enjoyable one. The return flight was an older A320-200, but with renovated cabin. The cabin was smarter and more comfortable. Flight meal was better than the first flight. Interestingly, we could use the aircraft wifi on our tablets to access the in-flight entertainment system. Unfortunately, there was no guidance on how to download the Studio KA app when connected to the aircraft wifi and it turned out to be a 4.5-hour flight with no in-flight entertainment again.

8269,easyJet,1.0,"""Beware of this company""",2023-06-12,True," Flight EJU7628 FNC-LIS was originally scheduled to leave at 22:00 on 02.06.2023 but was considerably delayed until 00:00 on 03.06.2023. The boarding staff at Funchal then informed that the flight had been cancelled. All passengers had already shown their boarding card and identification document. The boarding staff did not give any reason for the cancellation, only that they had just been informed. easyJet did not volunteer to send any messages during this hiatus. Legitimately outraged passengers shouted insults and kicked the easyJet queue separators. easyJet had a crew strike scheduled for 03.06.2023 from 00:00 but claims the ""delay"" [cancellation], was due to problems with the control tower, which is highly dubious because the TAP, Ryanair and SATA flights landed after the easyJet plane from Lisbon at 23:10 on 02.06.2023, without any disruptions. It was reported that easyJet had been transferring planes from European bases to Portugal with non-Portuguese crew, this combined with the strike in Portugal I believe was the real reason for the cancelation or delay, so the crew exceeded flight times. Despite appearing on the movement panel of Funchal airport as a cancelled flight, having in my possession and that I attach, photo with date and time watermark, besides the visible time on the panel itself, that the flight was cancelled. At this moment, abandoned at Funchal airport, I am forced to rebook a flight to Lisbon as soon as possible, which cost me an extra expense, inherent to easyJet's lack of professionalism, of 312.99 euros. Everything lead me to believe, with no room for doubt, that the flight was cancelled. Only at 01:30 of 03.06.2023, when I had already been forced to reschedule my trip due to easyJet's total lack of diligence, does easyJet send an SMS that the flight was rescheduled for 12:00 of 03.06.2023, 14 hours after the scheduled and original departure of the flight. easyJet did not provide the possibility to accept or refuse the rerouting, they only changed the booking and checked in by myself, without any consent, whether I accepted the new flight, wanted a cash or voucher refund. Under the terms of Articles 6 and 7 of Regulation (EC) No 261/2004, of 11 February 2004, I am entitled to compensation for the 14-hour delay I suffered - if it is not correctly considered that this was an effective cancellation - to the value of at least 250.00 euros plus the expenses incurred with the need to rebook on the nearest flight (312.99 euros), since easyJet had not informed passengers until 1.30 am on 3 June 2023. This makes a minimum total of €562.99, which I will never give up. Beware of this company.",A321N,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Funchal to Lisbon,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,June,2023

8344,easyJet,1.0,"""a very unpleasant experience""",2022-08-31,True,"  I would like to report on a very unpleasant experience with a baggage inspector and in this context I would like to claim back the illegally collected fine of 29€. The whole thing happened on August 17th, 2022 at around 6:20 p.m. at Gate A38 of BER Airport, where I and my travel companion should have boarded flight EJU5539 to Paris Orly at 5:35 p.m. So the flight was already delayed. Shortly before passing the counter, a very unfriendly baggage inspector waved me out. He said my hand luggage was too big. It was a business case (see picture attached), which I have been using for years with EasyJet. On the baggage measurement system, it also fitted perfectly in terms of height and width. It only exceeded the thickness by a minimum of approx. 0.5 cm (which the baggage inspector had to indicate with a pen).  When I then took the suitcase to repack something for my travel companion, the employee yelled at me where I wanted to go. He threatened me it's too late, I have to pay or the luggage will stay here. After I still managed to take out a few things and the case continued to protrude slightly over the limit, I tried to explain to the employee that this is just air in the case and that the exact dimensions can be maintained by pressing lightly. The employee then slapped my hands and yelled ""hands off"" and threatened again that the suitcase had to stay here. Under this pressure, I paid in order not to miss the flight. I suspect that the employee deliberately wanted to play off his position of power. Unfortunately there is no way to counteract this. The customer service in particular treats the customers here like dirt. Either you get an email with an answer with copy & paste FAQ's or on Instagram it is claimed that unfortunately nothing can be done. (Where there is a will, there is a way? ) Hiermit möchte ich von einer sehr unangenehmen Erfahrung mit einem Gepäckkontrolleur berichten und in diesem Zusammenhang die widerrechtlich eingezogene Strafgebühr von 29€ (siehe Kontoauszug) zurückfordern. Das ganze spielte sich den 17.08.22 um ca. 18:20 am Gate A38 des Flughafen BER ab, an welchem ich mit meiner Reisebegleitung bereits um 17:35 auf den Flug EJU5539 nach Paris Orly hätte boarden sollen. Der Flug war also schon verspätet. Kurz vor passieren des Schalters winkte mich dann ein sehr unfreundlicher Gepäckkontrolleur heraus. Er meinte mein Handgepäckstück sei zu groß. Dabei handelte es sich um einen Business Koffer (siehe Bild im Anhang), mit dem ich schon seit Jahren problemlos mit EasyJet reiste. Auf der Gepäckmessanlage passte er von Höhe und Breite dementsprechend auch perfekt rein. Lediglich die Dicke überschritt er minimal um ca. 0,5 cm (was der Gepäckkontrolleur mit einem Kugelschreiber andeuten musste). Als ich dann den Koffer nahm, um etwas zu meiner Reisebegleitung umzupacken schrie mich der Mitarbeiter an wo ich hinwollte. Er drohte mir es ist zu spät, ich muss zahlen oder das Gepäck bliebe hier. Nachdem ich es dennoch schaffte ein paar Sachen herauszunehmen und der Koffer weiterhin minimal über die Begrenzung ragte, versuchte ich dem Mitarbeiter zu verdeutlichen, dass dies nur Luft im Koffer ist und durch leichtes andrücken exakt die Maße eingehalten werden. Daraufhin schlug der Mitarbeiter auf meine Hände und schrie ,,Hände weg"" und drohte erneut, dass der Koffer hierbleiben müsse. Unter diesem Druck zahlte ich, um den Flug nicht zu verpassen. Ich vermute, dass der Mitarbeiter bewusst seine Machtposition ausspielen wollte. Leider gibt es keine Möglichkeit dagegen vorzugehen. Insbesondere der Kundenservice behandelt die Kunden hier wie Dreck. Entweder man bekommt als Mail eine Antwort mit Copy&Paste FAQ's oder auf Instagram wird behauptet man könne da leider nichts tun.

8553,El Al Israel Airlines,4.0,"""never been a premium airline""",2023-06-16,True," I have been a loyal customer of El Al for 40 years. I have flown intensively, especially during my years as a global marketing manager for an Israeli company. We are now retired and travel mainly for pleasure. El Al has never been a premium airline, but we usually have been feeling secure, safe and in good hands. Cabin crews have been attentive and an advantage for those that do not communicate in other language besides Hebrew. We pay a premium for that, never mind! Our last flight, May 2023, from Prague to TLV has been a summit of disappointment. First of all, we pay to flight on full fare category and none of the low, low cuts usual these days. You want to be competitive, do it by improving service not the opposite ways with cuts and cuts. To start with, the aircraft was, I think, Sun D'Or vintage, the sometime low cost company of El Al. They had probably rescued the plane from the El Al vintage museum. The aircraft had probably undergone some thorough technical check up (no problems with the flight itself). The cabin had been left for the last and forgotten. My particular seat was found not within the safety norms and we were required to move to another row. Fortunately the emergency exit row was available, but that is not the issue. The widely advertised El Al WiFi inboard was not functioning, in spite of the best efforts of the crew. The sandwich was tasty but, come on, this was not a low cost flight, no food, no coffee, water at the most. We had the option to check our trolleys and avoid the hassles of cabin carrying. For commodity we opted to carry them with us. But with such an aircraft, inside space was very limited and without too many explanations our trolleys were sent to the belly. Big difference : The cabin crew was in generally attentive and managed to do their best. The checking and boarding crew was unprofessional. No Hebrew speakers, no Israeli security personnel. Mind you. We pay a premium to have Israeli personnel in those positions, including stations chiefs. The boss of the departure crew could barely speak Hebrew. So, if you're going to be like the others then the game is open for all the Israeli travellers.

8615,El Al Israel Airlines,2.0,"""absolutely disgusting experience""",2019-04-23,True,"  I have been a loyal El Al member since 1993 (so has my entire family). Up until my very last flight, I have never had such issues with the staff and service and I may never fly with El Al again. Prior to booking my flight from Toronto to Tel Aviv, I called El Al office to ensure that I get an exit-row seat. The agent advised me that there are several emergency row seats available and seat number 45A is free. I booked the ticket online, selected that seat and got my confirmation email thinking everything is good to go, but it wasn't. Once I arrived at Toronto Airport, the  agent gave me my boarding pass with seat 45A, as they should have. However, in pre-boarding, they changed my seat to 28J (between people). I asked the reason why and the agent refused to answer! I asked for a supervisor, which informed me that 45A is a paid seat and the plane is full, therefore I will have to accept my 28J seat. I explained that I have a headache and I need a seat to be able to lean, as I have migraines from time to time. Please explain to me how this is acceptable, as my seat number was confirmed TWICE? After waiting for 15 minutes, the supervisor agreed to give me back my 45A seat. I proceeded onto the plane and after a short period of time, the supervisor came back onto the plane and kicked me out of my seat. When I asked the reason why, the supervisor said it's because of my migraine. What does my migraine have anything to do with my original seat number? The reason why I got a migraine in the first place, is because of your beyond unprofessional staff members and their horrible service. This was an absolutely disgusting experience flying with El Al and it could have all been avoided if staff just honored my original seat number and listened to me.

We've flown Singapore Airlines many times and El Al much to their credit has upped their game substantially and is on their way towards being a top 50 or even top 20 airlines! Food was delicious. El Al has ordered a total of 18 Dreamliners and as these become available the reviews will soar. The last time we flew on El Al was 10 years ago and at that time it was awful.

Check-in at EWR was smooth after the compulsory security interrogation (I strongly recommended one arrives 3+ hours if flying El Al in order to complete the check-in process). My interrogation lasted 10 minutes and it helped I was traveling with a group to Israel. Everything on the plane both ways looked brand new and the IFE was fantastic and state-of-the-art. Flight attendants were friendly and attentive and responded quickly to call button requests. Food (two meals) on both flights were edible and alright (chose the chicken dish on both legs and it was alright). Dairy/""breakfast"" meal was a choice of blintzes or an omelet on both flights as well. Chose the blintzes both times - they were nothing special but I was full from the previous meal. Check-in at Tel Aviv once past the initial security interrogation was fairly quick. My seat was assigned at the gate although they termed it as ""standby,"" which makes me wonder if they didn't expect me to be on the plane due to extra security searches of my bags? I can only guess that. At the TLV gate, approached the desk to get a seat assignment as the flight was boarding. The first lady I approached hardly looked at the computer and my ticket and said: ""it wasn't ready."" I waited 15 minutes and without any announcement coming about ""standby"" passengers, I approached a different gate agent who promptly assigned me a seat. They could not fulfill my request for an aisle seat but the gate agent was gracious with his apology. On the return flight, I was seated next to an unaccompanied minor and the flight attendant was very attentive toward him, asking how he was and if he needed anything during the flight. El Al does have online check-in but it's useless if you are checking bags or have to go through extra security procedures. Overall, however the experience on the 787 was great and I did not mind the extra security situations that come with flying El Al. That said, I'm not sure if I'd want to fly on them on some of the older aircraft.",Boeing 787-9,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Tel Aviv,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,yes,August,2018

Using many companies from Virgin Atlantic to BA to others, London is a major hub after all. It's been many years since I've taken a flight with El Al. See I am originally Israeli and take pride in all things from Israel, but this one even my best selling skills cannot spinoff. El Al is charging 900 pounds for a flight from Johannesburg to Tel Aviv (I do LND to JNB every two weeks) which is 9 hours duration, they use a plane from the 80s that is so dated in its seats, décor and electrical (no USB ports or electric plugs) and no entertainment device for an 9 hours flight (thanks for helping me to focus on my work more). If I've had any other direct flight I would simply not choose to fly El Al.

8666,Emirates,1.0,"""refusal to reimburse for damaged luggage""",2023-07-16,True,"  The issues I encountered include a significant problem with their cancellation policy, lack of responsiveness from their customer service team, concerning safety practices, refusal to reimburse for damaged luggage, an extensive delay during the return flight, and a stark contrast in service quality between Economy and Business class. Regarding the cancellation policy, I received misleading information from three representatives, who assured me that I would receive a full refund if I canceled within 24 hours. However, they failed to mention the crucial condition that this only applied when the flight was at least 7 days after the initial booking. As a result, I tried to cancel within the 24-hour window but could only reschedule. This cost me a $500 loss vs. the option of cancelling and booking a new flight for the following day. Despite Emirates acknowledging in writing their mistake, they repeatedly refused to provide a price match or refund, and eventually even stopped replying to my follow up messages on the open complain. The lack of responsiveness from Emirates compounded my frustration. Numerous follow-up messages went unanswered, showing a lack of interest in resolving the issues I faced.  During the flight, I was alarmed by a safety practice where all blankets were collected and piled in front of the emergency exits.  Emirates also declined to reimburse me for one of two damaged pieces of luggage, despite the damage occurring during their handling.  Furthermore, the return flight experienced a significant delay for a missing document, resulting in passengers being seated on the plane for over two hours, including boarding time. Despite the delay being just a few minutes short of two hours, the lack of updates, assistance, and provisions such as free Wi-Fi or refreshments left passengers feeling inconvenienced and neglected. The service quality and care for Economy class travelers fall short of expectations. ",A380-800,Family Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Milan,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,November,2022

The flight departed on time, the crew had a smile and were quite professional. Food was sufficient in quantity and quite good with metal cutlery in economy class. There was another snack service followed by juices/hot drinks 1.5 hours before landing. The seating is quite good and has a seat [pitch of 32""). B777s in use by Emirates are getting old and you can see the signs. Their ICE system was excellent. I am not sure I would like the Business class seats here as they weren't lie-flat but I was flying economy. Families with kids were well taken care of with flight attendants distributing amenities and offering to take and share instant pictures using Polaroid cameras. The in-flight wifi was free for text messaging using WhatsApp, even in economy if you have Skywards membership.

Service and food quality is poor. Options are limited and there is no dining in demand. It’s the first time I’ve flown business and had my meal served on a tray. Never addressed or welcomed by name aside from when my boarding card was presented on entering the aircraft. Crew were polite when you got their attention, but most of the time they were avoiding eye contact when racing through the cabin.

8683,Emirates,1.0,"""worst experience of my lifetime""",2023-05-31,True,"  I had the worst experience of my lifetime flying with Emirates. It all started from Thiruvananthapuram where our travel began, food was just pathetic and the service is just awful. Let alone the seats are not even comfortable with hardly any legroom. Sitting on the seat for less than an hour and you feel your bones crushing on the frame of the seat. The flight attendants seem like overly busy even if they were to walk past you and you ask them for a glass of water. The next leg was the long haul. Both my wife and I were just exhausted with the service and the flight attendants wouldn't even get a band aid after I cut myself from hitting my feet on the fasteners of the seat.  We waited for almost an hr after boarding from Dubai to take off and I ended up cutting myself while being seated and I showed my feet to the flight attendant, and she didn't even care to get back to me until my wife had to address it 48 minutes later.  The seats are as poor as the first leg. How do you expect customers to sit in these seats for such long-haul flights. No legroom and the people in front when they recline the seat your stuck with the tray on your diaphragm. I seriously dreaded the flight and the attendants as well. There was a lot of overhead Cabin baggage space where she could open and look but instead just chose to stand where she was and asked me if she could move my bag. Then when another passenger had to get his bag up, she asks my wife if the bag was hers and it was the bag of the passenger behind us. She was like it's my bag and leave it there and then the flight attendant got back to us and asked my wife to move her bag and I said no. Why don't you move the other bag instead. She didn't even have the courtesy to look for other bins if it wasn't full. But just stood in her vicinity to put the bag in and get the job done. I don't understand why do these kind of staff even work. Going to TRV via Dubai the men flight attendants were just so rude that they act like they are doing you a favor by getting you a glass of water.

On the 4th reset both times it worked but then suddenly while watching it stopped working again. They didn't even offer another seat and there was available options. This is crazy! Absolutely worse service and customer support ever. They have no vegetarian option. They only had Indian vegetarian option which is completely different and tailored for Indian cuisine. I would expect them to just change the main dish on the regular meal right but no! They brought vegetarian meal long before everyone else but didn't offer a drink. Cabin crew is always busy at the back and hard to get anything. They didn't offer socks, travel package. Just blanket and small pillow. I did fly with etihad, Quatar airways and Turkish airlines.

Check-in was ok, but was not given an express pass and was directed to the business lounge not first class as available for gold members. At boarding time most of the other passengers from economy were boarded before the priority boarding due to lack of staff at the gates. After boarding I asked for my meal after take off but after 1.5 hours nothing had arrived I had to call twice before someone came to me, it took nearly another 20 min before I got my meal, As my teenage children were flying in Premier economy, I checked on them but on both occasions was rudely told to return to seat my by the same cabin crew member and on the second occasion was questioned about my seat, this was totally embarrassing. After landing in Dubai I was not able to enter the first-class lounge unless I paid $420.00 for my son for 20 min, my sons airmiles were missing at the end of the trip. I complained to Emirates about the service and after 8 weeks was told the transfer company was a third party, boarding was a strict policy, that it was my fault not to help myself to some sandwiches, policy on lounge entry, and that my son was not an air miles member (he is), No apology or mention of the cabin crew behaviour, after responding to their response I basically told by them basically Emirates did not care about my business (over $250k) per year.

I have completed a round trip from South Africa to Thailand and Malaysia on Emirates, and have nothing but praise for their stellar product. Flight from Cape Town to Dubai was on a 777, which admittedly is beginning to show signs of age, but that did not stop the staff from giving excellent service. The other three flights were all on an A380, which was comfortable and made extremely pleasant by very friendly and helpful staff. All flights were on time, and served delicious food and drink to boot. In addition, the Business Class product offers extras such as lounge access and (in my opinion the best of all) chauffeur service, which works like clockwork. Maybe its the luck of the draw, but I personally think Emirates is tops.","1 x Boeing 777, 3 x A380",Solo Leisure,Business Class,"Cape Town to Johannesburg via Dubai, Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur",4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,yes,January,2023

I don’t know if it’s because they don’t pay the air hostesses enough or maybe they just became over confident. I took a flight from Bali (Indonesia) to London (via Dubai). Firstly , the stewardess’s are more focused on just giving champagne than helping the customers find their seat and helping with luggage. They don’t want to do any hard work. Can’t even be bothered to smile or pretend to be kind. The business part looked more like premium economy. (You definitely don’t get what you paid for on Emirates) 10 hrs flight to Dubai and nightmare. Food has got worse and worse over the years. I don’t know if they changed the catering? Total waste of my money and time. I should have flown Qatar Airways where you get your own cabin (with sliding door for privacy) and the air hostess are super kind and friendly.

8744,Emirates,2.0,"""the crew were nowhere to be seen""",2022-12-29,True,"  My Husband and I travelled on Emirates on November 24th 2022 from Seattle to Dubai, seated in row 19, and sadly it was the experience I was expecting.  This was a 14+ hour flight, and one would think the crew would be friendly and check on the passengers more, however the only time we saw them was during boarding, food service and disembarking and without smiles. After and before the food service the crew were nowhere to be seen. On other flights with other airlines the air hostesses will come by a couple of time with water/ tea/coffee or just even walk by to make sure if anything was needed. I understand people may want to sleep but you can also do it without waking up the passengers. Thirdly, the food was not appetizing, and not only that but if Emirates is releasing the menu on the app with a couple options (veg and non-veg) on the plane I was told I cant have the veg because I didn’t order it, Then why was it an option and it didn’t have anything on the side that said Pre-order. Ended up taking the meal with he chicken which was dry and hard like a baseball. I didn’t eat it. We were served a pizza snack and it wasn’t warmed up well. I am not one who leaves reviews but I understand that Emirates is a well renowned brand and company and my review will not matter to them but at the end of the day it was my hard earned money that I used to pay for my Flight.

8747,Emirates,4.0,"""it was very disappointing""",2022-12-20,True,"  First time flying business class with Emirates and it was very disappointing. A very early pre-boarding process in Amsterdam, while the crew was waiting in the tiny area as well for the airplane to be cleaned. So 500 People squeezed into a waiting area for an hour. Boarding is messy. Boarding music is terrible and, if delayed, played on repeat for hours. The seat is quite nice. The crew works very hard, but the service is just chaotic and messy with their trays, stuff stacked on top of each other. Meal service starts 2 hours after take off. On the way back used the business lounge in Dubai. It is far from the quality of lounges other airlines have, including most European airlines. Again delayed. Gipsy King music again for the 2 hours on ground during boarding. Poorly informed by the captain and mixed/contradicting info from the cabin crew. All the purser could say that “it wasn't their fault”. Overall, all facilities and procedures are quite average, food and drinks are ok.

8748,Emirates,5.0,"""not a very good experience""",2022-12-13,True," This was not a very good experience. Starting with the Airport, I was forced to check one of my carry-ons due to “no space” on the plane although it was not a full flight and I was made to pay a huge amount of money just for that and what’s worse is that the bag had a lot fragile souvenirs and I risked breaking all of them. Thank goodness it was loaded in Japan and no harm was done and the bag dodged a bullet. I don’t remember Emirates being that needlessly strict. I’m not sure if the airline changed the aircraft because the extra legroom seat that I paid for was different than the one I got as the exit door was in the way so I had to lean a little on the person next to me to get the full legroom feel. It was a long flight but it went smooth and the food was extremely delicious. The flight attendant that was assigned to our row, although efficient, made me feel like an inconvenience as she had very low energy and didn’t seem very enthusiastic to the point that while was pouring me apple juice, the carton ran out of juice while the cup was half full and that’s how she served it without bothering to open another carton. For the whole flight I was waiting for her to pass by us so I can ask the other, much nicer attendant for water and/or assistance whenever I needed something. For some weird reason, the much advertised On Air WiFi did not work which took another point out. ",A380,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Tokyo Narita to Dubai,3.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,yes,December,2022
8749,Emirates,1.0,"""worse than my already very low expectations""",2022-12-02,True,"  I have been flying Emirates for 15 years and was a gold member for much of that time. From 2007 - 2012 their customer service was almost unmatched but things have been getting worse over the past 10 years or so and now I would say it is the worst of any airline in the world. I have flown Emirates 3 times this year out of necessity and each time it has been a complete disaster. Emirates has now switched from operating like a typical full service carrier to something more akin to a low-cost airline. Not only do they have 4 fare classes (economy, premium, business & first) but each of those classes is split into 4 types (special, saver, flex & flex-plus). The saver fares usually look too good to be true because they are! If you find a low price on a special or saver fare when booking in advance you may think you got a good deal but try to make any changes to the flight and you will soon find that the airline tries to gauge you for extortionate 'fare differences'. Even if you try to change your flight to one that costs exactly the same as the flight you are on and there are empty seats in your fare class, they will tell you that your 'fare type' is no longer available and extort you for hundreds if not thousands of dollars to make the change. Even if the flight you're on is full and the flight you want to switch to is half empty (something you think the airline would be glad of) they still try to gauge you. If you're lucky enough to get through to customer service, they will not offer you any assistance whatsoever - their job is just to extract as much extra cash from you as they can. I have come to expect this and so avoid Emirates where I can. My latest experience with Emirates customer service was far worse than my already very low expectations. I tried to use the Emirates app to make a change to the flight time. I had a Saver fair so there was a change fee of £100. This was clearly stated in the terms and conditions of the ticket so I was happy to pay. However, when I got to the screen to put in my credit card details, the app crashed. I tried again and the same thing happened. Rather than keep trying to work with a defective app, I called the airline to make the change over the phone. A recorded message said that the airline was extremely busy and that if I was not flying in the next 48 hours, I should hang up and call back later. I complied with this request and hung up the call. As soon as I got back to my hotel room, I got on the laptop to make the change. despite only being a couple of hours later, there was suddenly a 'fare difference' to pay. Since it was the Emirates app that had failed when I tried to make the change and since their call center was too busy to take my call at that time, I was sure that Emirates would do the right thing and match the price from when I had first attempted the change. I thought wrong! I spoke to a hopeless fist line call center worker who could not help so I asked to speak to a supervisor. The supervisor said that he did not have any authority to make changes to flights, despite the fact that he told me that he was the most senior person in the airline I could speak to. Eventually, I was put through to another man a second level supervisor (or ""officer"")",A380,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to London via Dubai,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,no,December,2022

8930,Etihad Airways,1.0,"""I have learnt my lesson""",2023-06-20,True," BCN-AUH-LHE. Had a flight on 24th May 10.15am departure. After the boarding at BCN they kept us waiting at the boarding gate until 6pm, before announcing that the flight was cancelled due to a technical fault. During that 10 hours ordeal, no one had any decency to inform the passengers of what was going on, they kept changing the departure time with the increments of 1 hours. 1 snack voucher was provided which had a value of 5€, no lunch or drinks were provided. Finally at 6pm they told everyone to collect our baggage and wait at check-in area to be given hotel spaces. The off-loaded baggage arrived after 2 hours which to me was deliberate as they wanted to minimise the time passengers would spend at the hotel. Finally after another 2 hours wait in the queue, they told everyone to wait for buses to be taken to the hotel. The hotel was 1 and a half hour drive outside of Barcelona where we finally reached at 11.30pm. There was no communication as to when we will be picked up for our next day flight etc. At 4am, we were told bus had arrived for us, so hurried to the airport where they checked everyone in for 10.15am departure. At 11am, they told us that the aircraft that had just arrived from AUH to pick us up, was faulty as well. We were all then loaded onto the busses and taken to another aircraft which was parked at a half hour drive on the other side of the airport and finally that departed with the delay of over 2 hours. Abu Dhabi airport is another disgrace, you could smell the toilets from miles away, crowded space with low ceiling and rude staff. The flight to LHE was on a Airbus A320 with no IFE and in the name of in flight meal, they presented us with a bland sandwich.

The first leg to Abu Dhabi was with an A350, brand new plane. I must admit that Etihad livery is the best one I’ve seen. Along with on time-ish departure, unfortunately they are the only positive things I can think of. Although the plane was new, the seats are cramped, a thing that I noticed to many other airlines with new planes, and I am definitely not a tall person. They’re just pouring as many seats as possible which is very inconvenient for longer flights. Surprisingly, on the 777 plane from AUH to BKK, although was an older plane, the seats were much more comfortable, thus confirming what I mentioned above. The food onboard was just average, it lacks presentation and quality like you get on Qatar, Emirates or Turkish. IFE was just ok, not too many options to choose from. The crew was not as proactive as the other middle eastern carriers mentioned above. Together with AUH airport experience (an old and tired airport) I must admit that my first experience was not so great with Etihad and I really wanted to love them as they look so stylish (apparently only from outside).

The seats are super tiny, think child size but squeeze an adult into them. I’m not a large person at all, 5ft 4 female but was squashed in between two large guys, one who insisted on typing on his laptop most of the journey and continually invading my space with his arms/elbows. Refreshments are not very forthcoming and I had to keep asking for water, which when it arrived was half a paper cup. Food was disappointing. The only saving grace is that i didn’t get my upgrade to business offer accepted and waste more money as these seats also looked well past their sell by date.

Upon arrival in Abu Dhabi, the Gangway did not work, so we were made to wait another 35min before disembarkation. Needless to say the connecting flight to Riyadh was missed but the worst part of it was that the ground staff were completely clueless and hardly helpful. No service quality at all. I have Platinum status of Etihad as a frequent flier, but after that experience and the ridiculously high prices for average to below-average service quality. It looks like the Etihad management is detached from the reality of service the airline is providing in general.

8956,Etihad Airways,2.0,"""a very disappointing experience""",2023-03-03,True," Just had a very disappointing experience flying Etihad’s new business class on their A350. First the good: the plane’s interior design is very attractive. Now the bad: 1) Etihad uses Air India’s lounge at JFK. Seriously? This was one of the dirtiest and least attractive airline lounges I’ve ever been in. We left within minutes of arriving. 2) Many of Etihad’s online systems both app and online - just don’t function correctly. It was not possible to manage any part of my booking online or via the app. Not possible to choose seats or check-in. 3) While the plane is beautiful, scratch and you’ll discover that beauty is only skin deep. Many of the new plane’s innovations do no function properly. Outlets don’t work, the silly built-in phone charger didn’t work, the entertainment controller was extremely unresponsive and didn't work effectively. Seat was not comfortable compared to other business class seats. 4) The bathrooms were not clean and did not function well. 5) Worst of all on this flight was the service. While the flight attendants were nice enough, they didn’t provide some of the basic service I'd expect even if flying economy. Glasses and water bottles were never collected, my empty coffee mug sat on my tray for almost an hour and no one ever thought to ask if I wanted a refill. 6) The cabin was kept ridiculously warm making it impossible to sleep. 12 hour flight without a minute of sleep.

The worst person was the duty manager who even mocked at my wife who was a wheelchair patient. The lounge was outsourced as well and was a pathetic dump. Luckily I had a priority pass and could use other lounges. Boarding started on time and the flight was packed in every seta. The plane was dated but the service was overall very good by the Etihad crew. IFE was not bad and the food quality was very nice.

Crew was outstanding, formal and professional, yet engaging with passengers. The seat is stunning, very roomy, elegant, and does not feel claustrophobic. Food was extremely good: the menu is not that extensive but the quality of every dish is very high. You can order anything from the onboard menu, at any time. Pajamas provided are designed by a local Emirati brand A Friend Of Mine: drawing inspiration from traditional Emirati dress, I found these pajamas to be incredibly soft and comfortable. Amenity kit is stocked with Acqua di Parma products. In my opinion, this First class product is much better than Emirates First. Some areas of improvement: no amenities are offered in the toilet; WiFi quality and speed could be better (First passengers are given 200MB for free); champagne could be enhanced (Etihad serves Charles Heidsieck 2006, both Brut and Rosé, while Singapore Airlines, e.g., serves Krug in First).

I've flown the route from Melbourne to Vienna many times with Emirates, Qatar, Qantas, this was hands down the worst experience by far. Not only was the plane for this 13 hour flight 20+ years old, the seats were unbelievably uncomfortable, the bathrooms were filthy, on the first flight the toilet flushing button was smashed and covered in filth. The food was awful. On returning home, I looked to see if I could book a premium economy seat to alleviate the discomfort. The website told me the seats I selected were unavailable, but charged me 222.00 $ each time I clicked a seat. I was charged multiple times for seats that were unavailable. I immediately called Etihad and asked them to refund me. I was told I wasn't charged and my bank would release the funds in 24 hours. On the flight in question I was given one of the worst seats, in the very back of the plane in a seat that didn't recline. 5 days later, the money still isn't back in my account.

Our original flight was booked during COVID from Kuala Lumpur back to Istanbul, where we were living. They canceled the flight within 24 hours of booking, and would only issue a travel credit. They were intentionally keeping bookings open for flight routes that they were canceling to collect airfares and turn them into travel credits. Horrible customer service. Avoid at all costs.

We arrived 15 minutes ahead of schedule only to be left 45 minutes without any ventilation in the plane, as crew did not agree a car to drive the passengers to airport.

Warm drinks, no ice and 2 small drinks on an 8 hour flight. No tea or coffee facilities unless you went to them. There was no entertainment on board the flight. Even though TV’s were fitted to each seat these were not active. This made for an extremely painful and boring 8 hour flight!

I wanted to retrieve my membership number and password, which proved impossible over three months of trying. When asked to enter my name it would reply ""Please enter an English name.""  When I called customer service in Bangkok there was no reply ever. Cabin is nice, but small and cramped feeling, the herringbone arrangement is good but there is little privacy and the seats are narrow and not particularly comfortable. I am tall and have a disability so I'm not their ideal customer! There is no turn down service or mattress, so you have a blanket and have to put that down and sleep on top of it. The food was worse, though. As I recall, EVA always had great food and maybe Covid has impacted this. Bangkok-London offerings. Presentation is fine, we got a beef dish with a potato gratin that had a strange scent. My bead was microwaved plastic. The hostesses quietly apologized. Arriving at 6pm in London as it grew dark we were served breakfast. Congee, cereal and yoghurt and another weird omelette. There was a thing called Chicken with Red Cheese. This shows total lack of management. London to Bangkok was marginally better food wise. EVA doesn't have a lounge a Heathrow so they use the Lufthansa one. I need a wheelchair to get to gates they didn't send one. Boarding was an hour late, chaotic and disorganized.

9156,EVA Air,3.0,"""so little legroom""",2023-01-31,True,"  Mid-November the outward journey AMS – BKK in the Boeing 787 dream liner, to my surprise, very little legroom, not to say, very tight, in row 21 , but I was lucky row 20, with a lot of legroom, (you looked at the pantry, among other things), 2 empty seats. Consultation with a flight attendant and I was very spacious on row 20B, stretching my legs, etc. The return flight BKK-AMS was a true torture for me and others, so little legroom, I was now in row 28C, soon here and there some irritation and sometimes a fight, especially if someone pushed their seat back a bit (by the way, a seat like C is not really nice, people constantly bump into you, including staff) The passenger in front of me moved his seat back a bit, so I monitor was about 10 cm away. So I leaned back a little, to which a passenger behind me started grumbling, I didn't want any problems, so I stood up and patiently explained to the man; don't complain to me but do it at EVA, or fly premium, ok that problem solved quickly. My thought, apparently due to the new seat configuration EVA still wanted to cash in? Half November de heenreis AMS – BKK in de Boeing 787 dream liner, tot mijn verbazing, zeer weinig beenruimte, om niet te zeggen, zeer krap, op rij 21, echter ik had geluk rij 20, met heel veel beenruimte, (je keek oa tegen de pantry aan), 2 lege stoelen. Ff overleggen met een stewardess en ik zat op 20B zeer ruim, benen strekken enz. De terugvlucht BKK-AMS was voor mij en anderen een ware marteling, zo weinig beenruimte, ik zat nu op rij 28C, al snel hier en daar wat irritatie en soms ruzie, met name als iemand zijn stoel wat naar achteren deed (by the way een stoel als C is ook niet echt lekker constant botsen mensen tegen je aan incl. personeel) De passagier voor mij deed zijn stoel wat naar achter, waardoor ik mijn monitor op ong.10 cm afstand kwam. Dus ik ook maar iets naar achter, waarop een passagier achter mij begon te mopperen, ik wilde geen problemen, dus ben gaan staan en de man geduldig uitgelegd; ga niet bij mij klagen maar doe dat bij EVA, of vlieg premium, ok dat probleem snel opgelost.

This return leg was in Economy as unable to upgrade, having tried to contact BKK ticketing office for 3 days. The flight layout was supposed to be 3-3-3. On entering the plane noted that it was 3-4-3. We were sitting in the middle and I was on the outside with my wife in one of the middle seat of the 4. First thing. Noted how tight leg room was given the seat layout I couldn’t put my right foot flat on the floor. This was my first time in a 10 across format and compared against Thai Airways 9. I wouldn’t have booked if I’d known was 10 and again time of booking was only showing 9. Crew were very efficient. Food was very poor both meals and not a patch on Singapore Airlines as a 5 star comparison. The temperature on board was too low. People were putting on coats and requesting second blankets and hot drinks. I would not fly Economy with them again. Would this experience stop me using them again in other cabins, maybe not. But it’s a tough ask in Economy on this plane specification for 12.5 hours. Whilst Thai Airways is not as polished in terms of staff it’s a better experience on a 12.5hr Economy flight.",Boeing 777-300,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to London,1.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,no,October,2022

When we got to our seat there was a pillow and a blanket with headphones and cleaning wipes waiting for us. The blanket was very comfy and soft and so was the pillow. The seat was large and very nice for this 12 hour flight. We started cruising and went on the IFE screen, there was a lot of movie options and kid options, a few games, the flight map was excellent. The food options were very good. Chinese and a western option. Either Prawn and potato pie or Chicken thigh with black bean sauce. I chose the chicken thigh with Pineapple juice and Tea. I loved it, it was a good portion, had lots of flavour, it was a good sized meal. Very very tasty. Then I mostly slept. I got up and went to the bathroom, the crew were putting away the trolleys. They were very nice, this very kind crew came up to me and offered me some snacks. Of course I said yes. Then I slept more after that. Woke up and a few hours later breakfast was served. Prawn fried rice or eggs, I chose the fried rice. Again lots of flavour, it was another good portion and it was extremely tasty. I had tea and cranberry juice with it. Then we landed in Bangkok.

9185,EVA Air,9.0,"""It was a fantastic flight""",2020-06-27,True,"  London to Taipei during the pandemic. EVA only sells full fare ticket during this period so my tickets cost double of the usual price. However this is totally understandable, and I was able to select my seat once the ticket is booked. Check in at Heathrow was bit chaotic but this was due to the airport organisation to ensure social distance (which in my opinion only creates more queue than distance). EVA has requested some forms to be filled prior to checking in and also Taiwanese government requires online registration so they can monitor each single arriving passenger. The queue to reach check in took around 90 minutes. Once check in was performed it was very smooth to go through security. After security the only shops opened were Boots and WH Smith. Boarding was in good order. EVA enforced boarding zones to reduce congestion. Temperature of all passengers were taken and recorded. The crew members were in full PPE (goggles, facial mask, glove and apron) but still welcome passengers with a warm smile. The plane is a 3 year old B777-300 but it was spotless. EVA planes are perhaps the cleanest among all but it's evident that special cleaning had been implemented during this period. Most of the Taiwanese passenger also wore personal PPE and everyone was wiping their seat/table/screen once onboard. The flight pushed back some 30 minutes behind schedule due to delay on ground service. We were given amenity kits, blanket and a bottle of water while we wait on the ground. We were served two hot meals throughout the flight - one dinner and one breakfast. Both meals were tasty. They also announced few times that food and drink service was altered to meet additional hygiene standard. Toilets on the plane was kept spotless through the journey in a typical EVA fashion. Choices of movie/TV was limited. This has never been the strong point of EVA and perhaps during this tough time for aviation this has been cut back further. However I was still able to find some movie and TV programs to keep me occupied when I wasn't sleepy. The 13 hour flight passed quick and it was a very quiet 13 hours. All passenger wore their mask throughout. The flight landed in Taipei 20 minutes later than schedule but it only took me less than 30 minutes to leave the airport - that included buying a new SIM card, finishing the health screen registration, passing immigration and collecting luggage. The luggage was also disinfected before they reached the belt. It was a fantastic flight - very calm and relaxing despite the various measures enforced.

Cabin crew was very nice, attentive and supportive right from the beginning. The flight itself was easy going, I was amazed by the amount of cabin crew members because you do not find that onboard of western airlines anymore. Food was above economy standard, the only downside was the entertainment system. It was sufficient but nevertheless limited. Wheelchair service at Bangkok airport was very well organized, the cabin crew informed us right before landing about the available ground staff services.

The quality of the service and food on both my flights was fantastic. The cabin crew in Business Class are very attentive and quickly are at your seat as soon as your glass or plate is empty with another drink or meal course. As someone who works in the aviation industry I am all too familiar with the intricacies of an airline from front-line to behind-the-scenes. All four of my flights departed on time and when faced with a difficult situation (arriving 35 minutes prior to departure due to an airport-access issue) the ground staff were accommodating and whisked me through security. Surprisingly my baggage also made the flight which was something I was concerned with. If I had to find a negative it would unfortunately be the Plaza Premium lounge EVA Air uses in Toronto. This lounge was extremely basic and the food/drink options were minimal. For an airline who prides themselves on their quality I'd have expected them to opt for a better lounge option. On the other hand, their Infinity Lounge in Taipei was the complete opposite (obviously being that it is at their hub they have more control) with ample food, drink, and comfort options.",Boeing 777-300ER,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Toronto to Taipei via Tokyo,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,yes,September,2019

On-board the seats have more legroom and recline more, IFE screens are a little bigger, however I found the Movie, TV, Music selection really limited and only watched one movie. No noise cancelling headphones. I found the food was low-grade. The most annoying aspect of the trip is for anyone sitting in the last two rows is the constant noise, light and smell from the toilets, and traffic from the economy section behind was constant.

Tighter than on most of the flights I took lately (Avianca, Iberia, Air France), and recline is limited. Inflight entertainment (IFE) is individual (my guess of the 9"" type), with the now standard headphone jack and an usb plugs. Movies and series choice is quite limited with rather old movies, I was happy to have my own tablet loaded with series and movies. The plane seemed to be in good shape though. Food standards were those of Avianca so it is not really relevant for this review, but a pizza slice as a second meal was really a cheap move!! This plane seemed more like a charter flight type of setup, which would not have been a problem if I would have paid for a cheap charter flight.

However when we got to the airport they would not honour the seat reservations and we had to be given different seats. This was very difficult for us because my son is Autistic and doesn't like change.

So my husband and I 'short-checked' our carry-on bags to our next airline, since the next airline we transferred to would have enough room to stow them overhead. Then, we took this tiny 19-seater plane, which (once boarding was finished) started up the engines only to have them shut off three times, before the stewardess announced ""something is wrong, the pilots are going to try fix it"" (that's comforting) and gave out cookies to passengers to shift focus. Finally we were told by the pilots that there was a technical issue that could be 'deferred for now', and once they get paperwork done then we can take off. At one point early on, we were told it would be about 15 more minutes, then about half an hour later they said it'll be about 10 more minutes until takeoff. Overall we were delayed IN the plane sitting there pre-runway for an hour. And our next layover was 1 hr 20 min, so when we arrived at the next airport, we had literally 10 minutes until the next plane terminal would close the gate, to deplane, get our bags from baggage claim, go through security, and run to our next gate. Upon deplaning, we asked the ground crew if we could just grab our short-checked bags right there on the Tarmac, they said no. We were told the baggage claim was close by - which it wasn't. My husband and I ran (not a good idea when you're 7 months pregnant and not a runner by nature), he ran to baggage claim to get our bags while I ran to our next gate to try keep the door open until my husband arrived with our bags. As soon as I arrived, I was told to get onboard right now, and when I begged them to wait just a couple minutes for my husband who was running up as we spoke, they said they could not and closed the door right in front of me. Thanks a lot Ravn, for making us short-check our appropriately sized carry-on's,  having technically unsound planes, being untruthful about how much more time we'd be delayed on the Tarmac,  not letting us grab our short-checked bags after de-planing, and not apparently notifying the next gate that multiple passengers (including us) were delayed and on their way running to he gate. It ruined our night and our trip home, and we felt so ripped off by this airline.

Unlike crew in the US who hide in the galley to gossip among themselves after service, the Fiji crew are on their feet, preparing carts for the next service, interacting with passengers in the galley, and making rounds with water.

The A350 cabin from Helsinki - Delhi was an old tattered plane with dirty seats and very uncomfortable shape of seats. Definitely not worth the money for business class.

DAT couldn’t take in my dog in the hold which meant I couldn’t board the plane. It was in the middle of summer with all flights fully booked. I managed to book myself on a TAP Air Portugal which cost a fortune on short notice. Finnair has agreed to compensate me for that ticket but only with a gift card on Finnair.

I thought Finnair was a great airline which offers awesome blueberry juice, but it turns out to be an illusion. I had travelled with my partner from Paris to Penang, Malaysia with transits at Helsinki and Singapore (final transit was operated by Jetstar). Our nightmare began as we did not receive all of our boarding pass at Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris. The staff at the check-in counter did not provide us the boarding pass for the last flight from Singapore to Penang, without explaining further to us what was the problem and just told us to “look out” for help when we reached Singapore Changi Airport. Unfortunately, we had a delay at Helsinki Airport (they waited for some passengers) and the flight reached Singapore with about 30 minutes delay. We were worried about our transit at Singapore, as the stated transit duration was 55 minutes, while the actual time left was less than 25 minutes. We quickly rushed to the boarding gate (without our boarding pass, and we couldn’t find the transfer counter while manoeuvring ourselves through the packed Changi Airport). Well, the security denied our entry to the gate, and said that we were not in the passenger list on the flight. Exhausted after sprinting to the gate, we couldn’t do anything but to see our plane leaving the gate and departing without us. We referred to the transfer counter soon after, and they told us that our transit time was too short, and it was impossible for us to board our next flight. Jetstar personnel at the transfer counter arranged for us another flight in the late evening the next day, with a free entry to a lounge. Apparently, the lounge only offered us dinner and we did not have any accommodation for that night as the hotel was fully booked, thanks Finnair. On the bright side, we were given the opportunity to explore Changi airport for 24 hours, a whole day for us to rot there. As our compensation, Finnair did not check through all of our baggage for the replacement flight back to Penang. The personnel at Penang airport helped us to make a report on our lost baggage on arrival, and we finally got them back five days later. Finnair/Jetstar only made the effort to look for our luggage on the day we called to JetStar's office, and urged them to handle the incident responsibly. Finnair/Jetstar, please make sure that your transit schedule is arranged logically and with more consideration towards travellers, and if there’s any delay, please provide us with assistance to move between the gates. To future Finnair/JetStar's client, check your transit duration between flights if you’re travelling in a long haul flight, or better yet, avoid Finnair/Jetstar.",A350,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Penang via Helsinki and Singapore,2.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,no,August,2022
9466,Finnair,3.0,"""Very disappointing experience""",2022-03-29,True," Very disappointing experience. London wouldn’t check us in the whole way so there was a huge queue in Helsinki at the boarding gate to get our documents checked again. Secondly, I had 3 lots of seat changes to my flights without asking and or notifying me of the changes. I selected 1A in advance months prior. I noticed I was moved to another seat before departure. Spoke to customer service via chat who said 1A was blocked and unserviceable. I then moved seats online to my second choice to then find in Helsinki I had been moved again and dumped in a seat right next to the engine. And of course, when I boarded the flight someone was sitting in 1A when I had been told the seat was blocked and not serviceable. I feel like this airline doesn’t care about their customers in business class and they just blatantly lie about everything. I gave them the opportunity to rectify the issue, including providing complaint/feedback before departure which was not replied to.

The flight was supposed to take off at 235 pm, however before i left for the airport I checked the flair website which said the flight was on time, and i checked flightaware which showed that the flight was not leaving until 437 in the afternoon. My wife and i arrived at the airport and checked in with a very nice friendly and courteous young lady. During the check-in process i was asked to out each of my suitcases on the scale and then take them back because the luggage had to be brought by us to a special luggage drop area at the far end of the terminal. All of sudden we hear a man yelling at us to put our suitcases on the scale. The agent explained that we had already done that, but the man who identified himself as the Manager stated that he had not personally seen us put the luggage on the scale. I asked the man his name and position but he refused to allow me to see his ID. I asked the agent if the plane was going to be on time and she double checked all of her sources and she assured me the plane was on time. After over an hour waiting in the customs line, it was already 155pm so we were able to board the plane immediately. before i boarded i asked the gate agent if the plane was on time. She insisted the plane was leaving on time. I check the flair website and it still said on time and the flightaware website still said the plane was not leaving for another 2 hours and 37 minutes. The plane left the gate just a few minutes late, but then sat on the taxiway over 2 hours before takeoff. When we landed after 7PM, I received a text message from Flair that was sent at 411 PM stating that there would be a delay in the flight. I was quite disappointed in the plane itself, as on our first flight from FLL to YYZ there was a lot of advertising about the wifi and entertainment system. Unfortunately, on the first flight the wifi and entertainment system was broken, but in this return flight there was no system at all. Once on the plane, my wife was in the window seat of an exit row. There was a man directly opposite my wife at the window seat. It seems that the behavior of my wife and this man were very similar, but the flight attendant kept coming over to my wife to correct her behavior, but ignored the man who was doing the exact same thing. My wife's crime was using the tray table during the 2 hour period we sat on the plane before it took off, and for not wearing her sweater properly (storing it around her waist).

When I said I wasn't changed on the way there the attendant rudely replied ""Well if you don't pay you're not getting on"". This is after I paid to upgrade.  They seated me in-between two toddlers which the flight attendants allowed to run around the aircraft, knock on the pilots cabin door several times, also allowed them to climb all over me even though I asked both the parents and the flight attendants to please stop allowed them to run wild like this. It is an aircraft, not a daycare. I fly several times a year and usually go with United or Air Canada. This time I thought I'd try to ""save"" a couple dollars by flying this airline but when all was said and done with these stupid carry on bag fees, which I have never been charged for a backpack before for ANY other airline, it worked out to be the same as any other airline.

I made the mistake of purchasing a ticket from them, and it turned out to be a nightmarish experience that I'll never forget. From the moment I reached out to their customer service, it was evident that they lacked basic professionalism. The representatives were unhelpful and downright rude, leaving me feeling like an inconvenience rather than a valued customer. On the day of my flight, chaos awaited me at the airport. The check-in process was a mess, with long lines and confused staff who seemed clueless about what they were doing. It was a disheartening start to what would become an arduous journey. The condition of the aircraft was equally appalling. The seats were uncomfortable and worn-out, the cabin was far from clean, and the overall atmosphere was just plain unpleasant. It was clear that they had little regard for maintaining their planes. To make matters worse, the in-flight entertainment was practically non-existent, and the limited options available were outdated and malfunctioning. The lack of effort in providing a basic amenity like this was simply disappointing. As if the discomfort and inconvenience weren't enough, the food they served was a complete letdown. The tasteless and meager portions left me hungry and dissatisfied, making the already unbearable flight even worse.  Upon arrival, my fears were realized when I discovered that my luggage had been mishandled and damaged. Dealing with their customer service to resolve the issue was a nightmare in itself, as they displayed an astonishing lack of accountability and responsibility. In conclusion, my encounter with this airline was nothing short of a disaster. The unprofessional customer service, subpar amenities, discomfort, and complete disregard for passenger safety and belongings make this a company to avoid at all costs.

The economy seat, I’m 6’1 and 260 lbs and I fit just fine. It may have been a little bit less room than on one of the major carriers but it certainly wasn’t torturous I felt just fine. This is why reviews that exaggerate and say oh unless you’re under 100lbs you won’t fit are not helpful! The seats had a good recline too. The crew both ways were extremely professional polite and very friendly. My recommendation would be to order the chic bistro meal ahead of time on their site they provide a nice meal. If you don’t order the bistro meal (which is an additional charge) you will get a standard meal if you book the smart fare and this also entitles you to check in a bag. If you choose the basic fare however no meal or checked baggage is included. Snacks and drinks are also available for purchase on board. The seats all had seat back entertainment with movies music games etc.. French Bee is owned by the same company that owns the airline Air Caraibes and in fact our outbound flight from Newark to Paris was physically on an Air Caraibes plane while our return was on a French Bee plane. I think they May sometimes swap out the planes (all the same type A350s) between the two airlines. The only real complaint we had was that if you check a bag , the bag drop isn’t really a bag drop it’s more a you print out your luggage tag at the kiosk and put it on and then you wait online to see an agent anyway to give them your bag and go through the whole check in process all over again.

After checking in we were escorted through immigration and into the lounge. Drinks, snacks, and full pre-boarding menu was available . When it time came for boarding, we were escorted to the aircraft. After takeoff, the chef provided us with a very good selection of meals, when the food arrived as each meal was prepared by the Chef onboard it was very well presented and tasted even better. We had two full meals onboard additionally the cabin crew were available throughout the flight offering snacks and hot and cold drinks. The First-Class cabin is very comfortable and when it came time to sleep my family and I had a good rest. The cabin crew were very attentive to me, my wife and two children. Nothing was any bother for them, and they always greeted us with a re-assuring heartwarming Garuda-Indonesia smile. I recently read that Garuda-Indonesia on June 20th, 2023, was awarded the Best Cabin Crew 2023 and I would fully endorse this as they were outstanding on our flight.

10221,Garuda Indonesia,6.0,"""there were a few passengers moving around the cabin without having a mask on""",2021-05-29,True," Overjoyed about the chance to fly GA in their A330-900neo (DPS-CGK), few days prior to departure however, the aircraft is changed into B777-300-ER. Check in at GA flight business class always done at its class, a dedicated check in lounge. One concern on flight GA088 to AMS was, there were a few passengers moving around the cabin without having a mask on. What I found worse was when the cabin crews walked past those passengers and did not notice and did not give any warning. Once I thought perhaps those passengers just forgot to have their mask on, but no. Afterwards, I went to the in-charge crews in business class with an angry voice, to address my concern as to why they let such things happen in corona times. Although all GA cabin crews are vaccinated against Covid-19, they must have been more alert with the onboard situation like on any other airlines I have flown with. It makes me wonder, is it the lack of English of the crews or just an ignorance? I have written a few good reviews about GA flights, but not this time. They announced that all passengers must sit according to seat number on the boarding pass, but this is yet another issue. I had to sit in one seat far away from my travel companion because of the social distancing, but when one asked to move seat to the empty seat between us, it was allowed by the crew. IFE on GA flights are still below average, kindly do an upgrade. A pillow on board would have helped my quality of sleep.",Boeing 777-300ER,Business,Business Class,Denpasar to Amsterdam via Jakarta ,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,yes,May,2021

Flying during pandemic doesn't stop the cabin crew to provide their best service as always. Helpful, sincere, friendly and attentive, this is how I describe GA cabin crew. Meals served as always, course by course as if you are experiencing an A'la Carte dining. Unlike other airlines that decided to serve their meals in a box and cut services from usual, but not in GA. Covid-19 measurement is nicely done, all crews wearing mask and hand gloves. There is no unnecessary attributes. Business class lavatories are huge in comparison with KLM's I flew weeks ago. Seats comes in 1-2-1 configurations while many airlines are still on 2-2-2 or even 2-3-2. Social distance is well practiced on board which is the most important case nowadays. Same goes to some of their domestic route such as CGK-DPS will fly only wide body aircrafts to ensure the social distancing. Can't wait to experience this route in a few days after 5 days compulsory quarantine in Jakarta for all international arrivals to Indonesia.",Boeing 777-300ER,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Amsterdam to Jakarta,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes,March,2021
10233,Garuda Indonesia,9.0,"""They offer very good service""",2020-03-22,True,"  We flew with Garuda to Bali and back. Their service in-flight is very friendly and good. Checking in at AMS was a tiny bit of a hassle, due to the fact that they let this be handled by Swissport - they just changed this, so we didn't know beforehand. Checking in at DPS however was fine. Due to COVID-19 we needed to go back to NL a week early. Garuda offered special treatment as rebooking could be done at no additional cost (!!) which is very generous from them I think (in comparison, KLM, our national carrier in NL stopped flying at all!). I chat with the Garuda team online at saturday morning about our situation, and, believe it or not, that same evening we could fly back to AMS at 19:05! How's that for service? Checking in at DPS was very friendly and helpful. They arranged the new boarding passes for us so we could get back to NL safe and sound. Arriving in AMS we unfortunately found out that our baggage didn't come with us. In these rare conditions, due to the COVID-19 outbreak, a lot of people took extra baggage with them and Garuda was forced to leave a lot of it behind. I heard from multiple other people they had the same issue, but the baggage arrives fine a few days later. At this time of writing we don't have it back, but it has been just one day, and we should get it in about 3 days - so we don't worry too much about this. All in all, flying with this Asian airline the first time, was very pleasant. Seats of the flight (777-300ER 3U3) were quite large and spacious, but we are just shorties (1.7m) so no leg problems here. As we had a free seat next to us on both flights, we had plenty of space. The in-flight services (beverages and drinks) were also fine. We had chicken, rice and some veggies and another time we had salmon, rice and veggies. In between we got some bread and other small snacks. It was so unfortunate for the stewardesses to need to wear masks, as they all looked so friendly. In-flight connectivity was superb, compared to (for example) United, the Wi-Fi speed was so fast that you could even stream movies from Netflix or Prime most of the flight! Also, the pricing for Wi-Fi was acceptable at around 20 euros for 24 hours. As a conclusion I can really recommend flying with Garuda when you're flying from AMS to DPS (or the other way around). They offer very good service, bigger seats and most important, customer comes in front of money-making. Where our national carrier KLM just stopped flying at all, Garuda keeps flying for at least another week to get passengers back home in these difficult crisis times.",Boeing 777-300ER,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Denpasar to Amsterdam via Jakarta,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,yes,March,2020

In fact, it is so roomy when you need to get out of your seat your seat mate won't even need to get out of his/her chair, only needing to tuck their legs a bit back and you are out.

However that excitement soon faded and the worst business class flight I have ever taken. First of all the crew weren’t ready when we boarded, no alcoholic drinks were offered pre take off. It took them 3 hours to serve lunch. The starter was a prawn and the main course of beef was as tough as an old boot. Service continued to be incredibly slow throughout the flight. The thing that got my blood boiling was when a member of crew asked whether an ill member of crew could sit next to me? I said no because I didn’t want to catch what they had.

Although it is flat it's also angled and thin. Definitely not the comfiest. Would try and choose a different airline next time.

Garuda also seem to struggle in Business Class when the flight is full. I have to say that the service on this flight could have been much better. On boarding there was no introduction by the FA, we then had to wait for an hour to get a glass of wine off the crew and this was not replenished without asking.

With his help we were checked in very quickly and then escorted through security, immigration and into the lounge. The lounge used by Garuda at Haneda is also used by other airlines, therefore was very busy, however we were able to find a place for us to sit together. The food and drinks available in the lounge was adequate. When time came for boarding the Garuda ground support team were on hand to escort us to the plane. At the plane we were greeted at the door by the cabin crew who provided us with a very warm welcome. They certainly know how to treat their passengers and make you feel very welcome. There was a very good selection of food and drinks available and the quality, presentation and taste was excellent. Although the Cabin was full the Cabin crew kept coming around and offering warm and cold drinks together with snacks. They even went out of their way to help and assist my two children with additional snacks through out the flight. Additionally on the flight Garuda provides free onboard Wi Fi for the total duration of the flight and the speed of connection was quite impressive.

Disappointing as Garuda should provide a broader choice as well as live TV. Free Wifi connection didn't work for me as I don't use WhatsApp, but other passengers seemed to be using it. Other apps didn't work at all. The flight was delayed for an hour due to bad weather in Bali and they didn't catch up the time lost before landing in Amsterdam, which was fine with me personally, but others might consider this disappointing. The plane was only half full, which meant that I had 2 seats for myself. Leg room was great, and seat good. Sadly they did not offer beer or wine on the DPS-KNO flight, only KNO-AMS.

The ground staff has also been criticized for being unprofessional and confused at times, highlighting the need for better training. Furthermore, Gulf Air does not have its own lounge facilities and instead relies on Air France's lounge in Paris, raising concerns about exclusivity. Champagne served on board was warm, showing a lack of attention to detail. Gulf Air's affordability is a selling point for budget-conscious travelers, but there are compromises. The lack of a separate business class lane, unqualified ground staff, reliance on external lounges, inattentive service, and warm champagne all exemplify the compromises passengers may have to accept for a lower fare.

10755,Gulf Air,1.0,"""I will never fly Gulf Air again""",2019-10-11,True,"  After having an amazing discovery of Oman Air, I wanted to try Gulf Air’s business class as it was basically the same aircraft, same type of seats and additionally it had a Sky Chef on board. I was expecting even better service than Oman Air. Gulf Air has the same type of aircraft 787 and same type of seats. The seats are just amazing. Specially the window seats are private suites. This is where the good part ends with Gulf Air experience I had for the 4 business class trips I just completed. First of all no Champagne was served for the welcome drinks which is a standard for any airline on business class. I had to request it. With a strange look on her face, FA did bring me a glass. Then the food order came and I had to inform the sky chef I had ordered a special meal. He didn’t have on his manifesto. No one greeted or mentioned any passenger by name. Almost everyone had special meals and they all got mixed up. Sky Chef plus a purser plus 3 FA for 6 passenger (most of the seats were empty). They couldn’t figure out who and what. There isn’t a wine list. They ask you white or red. Italian or French. I requested Italian red and my partner French red. FA brought one bottle to everyone :)) and served. When I asked for a glass of water (a water glass was on my food tray yet empty) the old purser indicated a bottled water next to my bed. I informed him I rather use it if I wake up during the flight thirsty. He brought me another bottle. worse part comes before the landing. I requested just coffee no breakfast. Same for all other 5 passengers except one. The old male purser informed us that they closed the kitchen (60 min before landing?). Yet he did open a service and served a Bahraini customer. This is when it all went wrong as one passenger demanded breakfast as well. Purser was so rude that he informed us that this passenger was their special guest as he is a frequent traveller. Entertainment is a joke. There is just a few movies, few series - all very old. You must beg to get anything done. I had to demand for a pajamas and mattress for all my flights although this was what they have been advertising. Amenity kit is very cheap.

I wasn't disappointed. Many frequent flyers have harsh criticism of Chinese airlines, but my flights with two of them (China Southern and Hainan) were both exceptional experiences and the equal to that of the more well known and appreciated carriers such as Singapore or Cathay Pacific. The onboard service on my Hainan flight to Beijing was outstanding. The purser made a point of introducing himself to each business class passenger, and henceforth addressed each of us by our names. The meals and wine list were of the highest quality. The bathrooms were kept spotless throughout the 12 hour trip and were provided with a range of creams and colognes, but strangely, no soap. Hainan arranges the business class cabin on some of its 787's in a 1-2-1 herringbone pattern. These seats are great for comfort and privacy, but for passengers who enjoy sightseeing during the flight, the window seats are at a distance from the window itself, and seeing out is a challenge.

I asked him for a Coke while he was serving food and drinks, but then I politely asked him to exchange it for a zero. I used all sorts of polite words when I asked him, so I didn't feel I had offended him in any way. But he reacted to me with extreme impatience. He even stopped, looked at me and let out a loud sigh. I told him I was sorry when he changed it for me. But then the more I thought about it, the angrier I got, because it wasn't my fault at all, and he had no reason to be impatient with a small request from a customer.

When I inquired about food after 5 minutes, they abruptly informed me that no food will be served at this time. The strangest thing is that if I purchase with a credit card, they would deliver the food. This is inexcusable. During the journey, I only received a small amount of juice.

We were herded into a small, overcrowded Departure Lounge with insufficient seating, suffocatingly hot. Not a single member of staff from whom information could be gleaned was present, nor was any announcement made with information or explanation for over an hour. Thomas Cook aircraft was substituted with Hi Fly. We had paid for Premium Class with allocated seats which were not available on the Hi Fly Aircraft (Our row 4 Seats (A4 and C4) were non-existent. We were told by the Flight Attendant that rows 1 to 3 were the Premium seats but when sitting in vacant seats alongside other similarly displaced passengers, were told that we were to move to the next section and choose any! I remonstrated with the staff to no avail so had to be relocated to already occupied seats therefore displacing a passenger. After boarding we sat on the aircraft for one hour and forty-five minutes before leaving the runway at 17.45. Inflight entertainment screens were not working. We were given Ipads which were collected in, without exception, far too early - three hours before the flight landed even though passengers were in the middle of films. Of the two toilets in our section, one had no flushing water. No alcoholic drinks were available when they should have been in Premium Class. Ice-cream which was offered immediately after the meal, was totally melted and required drinking. When my wife was feeling ill during the flight, I asked three times for a ‘sick-bag’ before being told that there were non-available and eventually a plastic bag was found.

Flight was quite expensive but I had to book it last minute and no other options were available, as this was the Christmas-New Year period. I arrived well in-time for check-in at Auckland Airport; scheduled departure was 10:15 am, and I arrived just before 8 am. Online check-in was not available for this flight (no reason given). Only two counters opened for check-in at the airport for Hong Kong Airlines. There was already a long queue for what it looked like was a very full flight, and the line was getting longer behind me as well. Check-in process took awfully long; The three ground staff were slow, rude and unapologetic. I was still waiting for my turn at the scheduled boarding time of 9:30 am. They had to rush the last 20 or so passengers for check-in and rudely told us to run to the gate or we'll miss the flight. No priority was given at security, and no airport carts were used to transport us to the gate. I double-checked both at check-in and at boarding-gate with staff to ensure both my check-in bags were on the flight, considering the check-in was hectic; I was assured both times that my bags were on the plane. We finally made it onto the aircraft and departed almost 30 minutes late. Plane and seats were old but nevertheless comfortable - I had a window seat at the back of the plane; curtains and interior were a warm red colour. Cabin-crew were surprisingly nice and attentive; leg room was sufficient and I managed to get an empty seat next to me. Food was delicious, toilets clean, and the help-yourself-minibar at the back of the plane made the difference. IFE was mediocre; not a lot of choice but sufficient. Arrived in Hong Kong 20 minutes ahead of schedule. I went to the transfer desk in Hong Kong Airport to make my Jet Airways connecting flight, here they advised me and some of my fellow passengers that due to late check-in at Auckland, out bags weren't loaded onto the aircraft and they will be coming on the next flight. After I arrived at Mumbai, it took 5 days for them to deliver the bag to my Mumbai address after countless calls and E-mails.

So it is utterly useless if you want to arrive at the airport earlier and save time for shopping or going to lounge to rest after going through the customs.

The flight was delayed for around 40 minutes, which was nice, at this occasion interestingly. The A333 is equipped with inflight entertainment, of which I can watch movies and listen music, pretty good. The legroom is within reasonable range, not spacious but acceptable.

They were not even airline personnel. I went to the lounge and called the airline. They said the plan was now a 7 pm departure, and the plane was still in HKG. The plane finally boarded at 8 pm. We then spent 4.5 hours parked at the ramp while the pilots waited for a takeoff slot. Finally arriving at 3 am in HKG (3 hours after my connection left). In HKG, the staff were very rude about rebooking and told me that I could wait until they were ready. Apparently they started work at 4 am, so we needed to wait.

11182,Iberia,1.0,"""unhelpful and not service oriented""",2022-08-16,True," Where to begin, I guess at the beginning. At check-in their computers were down, so it took a long time to check our luggage in and get boarding passes. Very unhelpful and not service oriented - I pulled up the health screener of my final destination, TLV, but it was not in a format they wanted so they said I would not fly if I couldn't pull it up. 3. Poor customer service. My seats from Madrid to TLV could not be assigned in DFW because they have subcontracted employees without full rights. Our first flight from DFW to Madrid got delayed, which is not a huge deal, but it got delayed even further because they could not match the passenger list with the amount of people on board. The flight crew could not understand the delay either, which they expressed to the passengers. Madrid to TLV was ok. TLV to Madrid 8/12 flight got moved up, I had to change my itinerary, customer service number would hang up on me. I could not find Iberia employees at the airport. Flight delayed and unprofessional - We were told the computers were down, they used a different airplane, and that we could sit anywhere. Then the ""musical chairs game began."" They started moving passengers left and right to balance the plane, just during take off and landing, then we could go back to our seats. The crew looked confused and dumb, like they didn't know what they were doing (because they didn't). Uncaring and very poor customer service - At Madrid they would not even consider putting me in an earlier flight, after disrupting my schedule, that was operated by AA on Iberia’s behalf because according to the Iberia agent: “They won’t give money to AA for taking you back.” At my arrival in DFW my luggage never arrived, despite being there way early, and the agent they had was again a subcontracted employee without access to their system, very young and untrained. He provided me with a handwritten form to fill out, no reference number was given to me. I did that and left because I was exhausted. 9a. Went to the airport the next day, Iberia’s counter was nowhere to be found, no employee available, nothing, just a ghost airline! The next day I call customer service and they could not help because their system was down, I proceed to explain my ordeal and worries about this flawed system and she replies - “I don’t control what happens at the airport and then cut off the call and sent me to a survey. Second CS call - She had said to call customer service back in 2 hours. I called customer service in 3 hours and the agent located the luggage in Madrid. I asked her to open a formal claim for my luggage, she said she couldn’t do that through her system. I exclaimed - “Then what are my options? I couldn’t do it at the airport, and I can’t do it now either.” She recommended for me to go to their website and fill out my complaint. Third CS call - I explained that I’d like to know if my luggage was in transit, the CS guy asked me for the reference number, and I explained that this airline is not like a normal one that would issue one at the airport. He assured me the luggage was in transit but without that PIR (reference number) they would not deliver it to my house, and I’d have to get it from the airport myself. Granted the airport has no available personnel if there is not a flight they are working, they don’t have a local office or nothing like that.",A300,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Dallas Fort-Worth to Tel Aviv,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,no,August,2022

They then proceeded to make us go through immigration and wait another two hours for luggage. We had to wait for two hours for information on which hotel we were at and another two hours for a bus.  No information on when our flight was and if it was even going to leave for nearly 20 hours. Finally we heard from hotel reception that our flight was scheduled for 10 pm at night (29 hours late). We boarded a bus to the airport. The flight was not live on the airport’s departures. When at the airport the check-in for business took 1 hour as the check-in was severely understaffed. The check-in  put the wrong date so we were delayed 30 minutes at immigration while they confirmed the flight even existed. After taking off at 11:30 pm late, the pilot had the audacity to say “we were extremely lucky to be on this flight and that we should thank the technical staff” as we would have had to stay three extra days in Quito had it not been for them as other flights were full”,, merely stating “thank you for your patience”. The lack of communication by the airline was nothing short of abysmal. They lost our luggage on the way to Quito and we had to wait for four days to receive them in the Galapagos one hour before our boat left for 8 days.

11187,Iberia,6.0,"""not credit any more miles with partner airlines""",2022-07-16,True," I have just realised that Iberia will not credit any more miles with partner airlines, or at least not with the AAdvantage program of American Airlines, In the last 3 or 4 flights that I have done with Iberia, the only way I got my miles credited was by requesting the missing miles through AAdvantage, because Iberia never credits them by itself (in contrast with Qatar or British Airways which credit them in a matter of days). Finally, after requesting missing miles once again, AAdvantage sent me a mail denying my request on grounds of ""Airline unable to validate"". This is despite that I sent the boarding pass issued by Iberia and that my AAdvantage number is printed on the boarding pass itself. It really is disappointing. I believe this is becoming a generalized policy, given the rough times that airlines have gone through since the pandemic.",A320,Business,Economy Class,Madrid to Hamburg,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,no,May,2022
11199,Iberia,8.0,"""really good experience""",2022-06-20,True," I was really looking forward to this flight as I do fly between Madrid and London a lot and Iberia flies also their A330s and even A350 on this route so picking up time to try their A350 was no brainer, Iberia also offers upgrade to business class at check in, you won't get extra miles or extra baggage allowance, but you get full experience, fast track, lounge and of course on board experience. This time it cost 52 Euros, which is a pretty good price and worth paying. I got to airport only 2 hours before as I was busy during the day, checked in my carry on (you can for free) as I was filming this experience as well and went through fast track, which was close at London Heathrow, you only got to skip most of the line. The flight was leaving from Gates C, but there is no lounge there, so I went to BA lounge right after security, which was a bit crowded, but managed to get a seat, got some snack and drink, for hot food you have to use QR code and order online, but didn't have much time as boarding started already. Took me like 15 minutes to get there, but you can board any time using priority lane, unfortunately everyone boarded through one jet bridge, even though there were more doors and it could have been done differently. On board I had seat 3L which was really wide, comfortable and I like that its 1-2-1 so everyone has aisle access which is great, unfortunately my IFE wasn't working so I was moved to 8A which is exactly the same type of seat, most private one which is exactly what I wanted so all good. There is no pillow or blanket on this 2 hours flight which makes sense and no pre departure drink which is lacking a bit. Headphones are good though and I can't complain. Seat in general is very wide and comfortable and I'm sure I would be comfortable to be there for 10 or more hours. Business class passengers also have free Wi-Fi, even though only basic, but better than nothing. Service started around 30-40 minutes and there were two food options, I took a beef and it was good, its served on the tray, but I get that its short flight and for drink I got gin and tonic and coke. Overall happy with service, as for IFE, there are plenty of choices and I'm sure I would have enough things to watch on 10 hours flight. Overall really good experience, just one little thing, crew pretty much always start speaking Spanish and keeps doing it, would be better if they first ask you if you speak Spanish and than try to remember at least for business, I get that economy is too big.

11201,Iberia,2.0,"""have never seen such unhelpful, frankly lazy, and rude customer service""",2022-06-15,False,"  The ground crew at check in at the JFK Airport in New York is the worst, without exception, that we have ever encountered! It is unbelievable that an airline could maintain such poor representation of their airline company and in fact they were so bad that somehow there appears to be terrible supervision and management. We flew from JFK-MAD on 6/5/22. The check in process started about 40 minutes after the time on the board and that could be caused by any number of reasons, but despite a long customer line for the full flight and about 6 people milling around behind their counter, no one ever explained anything and didn't even look at any of the passengers in line. When they opened the check in finally and we got to the counter, we were told that there was an additional form to be filled in. We had our passports, COVID shot cards, and had provided all online information on the American Airlines website which is how we booked the flights. We asked for help in understanding what we were to do and the incredibly rudest of the lot, a female actually right in front of us, put her head in her hands and turned to one of her co-workers and said, ""and this is how I have to start my day?"". We were literally stunned! I have never seen such unhelpful, frankly lazy, and rude customer service ever on other airlines. Hopefully Iberia will start some sort of supervision process.

11209,Iberia,1.0,"""this was the first on Iberia - and the last""",2022-04-28,True,"  I have flown business class to Europe regularly from Panama and return over the last 10 years, using all the European airlines that cover the trip, all the American and even South American this was the first on Iberia - and the last. The plane was 5.5 years old. Seat, very little storage, very thin padding, I had to sit on my pillow to make it comfortable. Service, no menu, no pre dinner drinks, food served all on one tray covered in foil and plastic wrap. No real explanation of what the food was. No after dinner drinks. I asked for a scotch and I was told that they weren't sure whether it was available. IFE was poor. Offered 30 mins of complimentary WiFi, it did not work. Sleep was impossible due to crew constantly using the toilet at the rear of the BC cabin. Although the toilet was not cleaned until just before we landed and deteriorated during the 10 hour flight. No toiletries available in WC apart from soap. Cabin too warm even for my partner who like me has lived in the tropics for 10 years. No hot towels, no cold towels. Breakfast was lukewarm at best and it consisted of an inedible omelet thing, 3 bread rolls same as for dinner, no butter, a pot if jam, fruit and yogurt, the latter being at least edible. Overall the staff seemed non-interested in the customers and I do not think I have been more disappointed in an expensive business class ticket.

11224,Iberia,4.0,"""Food was eatable but no more than that""",2021-11-28,True,"  Between average and under average to sum up my flights. Boarding for business passengers in Lima was perfect: very orderly and quick. The usual oldish looking business cabin pretty worn out. When I asked something else than the 2 choices for the welcome drink: plain water or cava (the Spanish sparkling wine), I was told: ""after take off"" Even if I asked for it again twice I had to wait 1h10! and it was given to me at the same time as the meal: Iberia staff likes to make the minimum efforts possible. The dinner was dreadfully presented on a tiny tray (size of a coach meal tray) and in a very oldish and ugly china. No menu with the usual Covid excuse. So I was asked ""Beef or fish?"" and when I asked how they were prepared I got the 2 same words snapped back to me. Food was eatable but certainly no more than that, and the presentation did not make you hungry. Appetizer was canteen style, meat was tough and overcooked, cheese truly bad and desert bad. Apart from the beef or fish, no choice. To be honest the wines were good but once again no menu to know what you were drinking. Between the dinner and the breakfast we never saw a crew member: doesn't Iberia train the cabin crew to treat decently business class clients decently? And in my fair opinion of ultra freqent traveller the Iberia executive in charge of food should be transferred to some another department asap. Business passengers are entitled to 30 minutes wifi: never worked! even if on my outbound flight it did.

Serious problems with cabin crew, service/hospitality is non-existent. We travelled in both economy and premium economy and the service and food were equally bad in both. In premium economy, I wanted to ask for some water so I put my call bell on - this was ignored for about 15 minutes (though many crew saw it) before one woman came by, turned the call light off and walked off. I had a laugh about it with a guy across the aisle, we were both in awe at the spectacularly bad service. I also spent hours and hours on their website trying unsuccessfully to check-in, it just kept freezing, tried to call customer service, was on hold for 10 minutes before being disconnected (several times) because the call centre was supposedly too busy. In summary, customer service on and off the plane is atrocious. Food was also pretty poor, on both 9 hour flights, the first meal was mediocre quality (at best) and the second meal was a banana or a packaged muffin. The only positive thing I can say is that they offer last-minute upgrades for quite reasonable prices. Perhaps worth the gamble to go long-haul business or premium economy for an extra hundred euros or so.

The Check-in for my luggage was quick and easy, and they also printed one boarding pass for both of my journeys. They were very communicative with passengers as we waited for boarding to begin. While it is not very organized boarding, it went by quickly. I did pre order food, which I was satisfied with. I don't typically sleep on flights, but they did provide a blanket and pillow already placed on your seat. As well, I saw them walk around the plane offering water to passengers throughout the 5 hour flight. The way I booked my flights to Scotland left me with an hour layover in Iceland.

Then on our return flight on December 30th it was again delayed for 2 hours then when we finally took flight the airplane was returned to Aruba due to another malfunction, then we stayed in the airport another 8 hours and lost our connecting flights in Miami, the airline is using old airplanes from the 70's and 80's with visual wear and tear. The attendants at the airport are clueless to say the least, all the said was ""I don't know"". I really regret saving $180 per ticket compared to American Airlines for the same route.

I have never seen so much care in applying the baggage tags. I think there were 5 tags in total per bag. The flight was on time and uneventful. The plane was quite new (4 years) but had no entertainment system, apart from some scattered displays - they do show the takeoff and landing which is kind of cool for a plane this size.

Therefore I had to wait for 12 hours at my connection airport and the only compensation they gave me was a food coupon worth 7€ which could only be used at 3 restaurants of which 2 were closed.

I thought that it was a fluke that the airplane was damaged going, but returning it was the same. Broken seats, broken trays, torn or ripped seats. The lavatories do not have paper towels, toilet paper, or Kleenex, when I asked the flight attendant she said “sorry”, but then again that was going and returning.  This is their standard operating procedure, how sad. Once in flight the attendants are handing out hot soda and when asked for ice, they ask “do you have a thermos”? When I told her no, she handed me 3 ice cubes in a plastic cup and was upset.

On the negative side I can honestly say I have never seen a crew on any airline so mean, nasty and unpleasant. I'm a 60 year old guy and asked for some water late in the flight. The flight attendant snapped at me and said no, we have no water. They did not distribute landing cards before landing. I had to ask for them as I left the flight. They gave me one of the two required. I saw them in customs and called them out on all of this - their mean nasty attitudes, unwillingness to pass out customs forms. I don't need to be abused by these people. If it was my company, they all would be fired already for their lack of professionalism and disgraceful behavior. Amazingly when I walked them out on their nastiness they agreed with me and acknowledged it. Also, their website is disingenuous - they talk about wifi connectivity video screens, audio all on 'some' flights.  There is zippo.

No clean information about the hand bag policy - resulting in huge chaos and charging 50$ for a small Ryanair backpack of 4,5 kg! No in flight service, menu on board is only in English with no clear pricing. Despite the plane was half empty - to change the seat the crew required extra payment even after boarding completed.

Aircraft are crazy old and in disrepair, seats terribly uncomfortable. On the FCO-VCE leg no difference in snack or meal than economy. So in the end what's the point?

The food was a good standard, with 1st & 2nd starter (pasta course) along with a main course although desserts disappointing. Dinner & breakfast served with snacks on offer such as a rustic pie There were a couple of points to note: 1. Window seats offer a lot of privacy but I sat in 8A which was missing a window 2. Seats are very hard leather with no mattress topping, I had to use a spare duvet to make is softer but still wasn't comfortable enough 3.

11774,ITA Airways,2.0,"""Dreadful experience""",2022-06-24,True," Dreadful experience, but they’re the only airline flying the route non-stop. My first experience was trying to pay for seat selections and checked baggage. Their website forwards to Alitalia, so unless the website language is set to Italian, the transaction does not go through. During one attempt, I was charged to my credit card, despite the transaction on their website showing an error for “time out”. It took about three hours to figure out how to pay for seat selections and checked bags. When it came time to check in, I noticed that my seat selection I had paid USD 75 was not applied to my ticket, so called the help desk. After waiting on hold for what felt like an eternity, I was told there was nothing they could do, as the plane was full, so to email their complaints team for a refund. I did that over a week ago now and have received no response, so just filed a dispute with my credit card. I then found out that the airline doesn’t participate in TSA Pre-Check, so had to wait over an hour at security even though I have Global Entry (which includes TSA Pre-Check) for the specific reason of avoiding long security queues. Once boarded, I intended to use the WiFi do work for business purposes in order to not fall behind, but soon discovered the WiFi was not functioning and did not function throughout the entirety of the flight. Meals were small and insufficient in frequency. We were served two small meals once the course of the 12-hour flight. Snacks were kept at the rear of the plane, and given how many passengers frequented the snack bar, it would seem many people agreed with my sentiments. The service I experienced with ITA Airways was a sorry start to what would ultimately be an absolutely incredible holiday.

Plastic glasses, no champagne, no gin and tonic and then no white wine. Offered cheap prossecco which then ran out. To charge this money and not offer a fully stocked bar is unacceptable. The salad was disgusting.  Worse than this at check in the agent told us the business lounge was at gate e41 so we went miles to get there and as my husband is registered disabled this was quite a long walk. We were told at the lounge that ITA didn't have use of this lounge but we had to go back to gate 11 - miles back. so we sat and waited at gate e44 for an hour and a half when we could have enjoyed the business lounge had that agent given us correct information. This was such a poor experience. I left a complaint with the purser who said they didn't have much loaded since the pandemic?

11788,Japan Airlines,1.0,"""both flights are my all-time best""",2023-07-25,True," At Changi, despite still being 5 hours prior to departure, the ground staff team let me check in early, and I was glad that I did even though I had checked in online because the process took quite a long time due to this being a US-bound flight. Eventually, I was sent through the automated gates of passport control, and after some rest, I made it to the gate. Boarding was made on time, and strangely, neither I nor my other family members was allowed to accompany our travel party who needed wheelchair assistance, something that was not the case on the Haneda-Los Angeles leg. Having purchased this ticket through American Airlines, JAL and AA made a miscommunication that eventually led to me and my other family members being seated separately from each other on the Singapore-Haneda leg of the trip, but I believe that was a fluke because the seats on the Haneda-Los Angeles leg was set correctly. What I got on both legs were friendly cabin crew despite the agonizingly long duration of the flight, sumptuous meals, in-flight entertainment system with a great selection of contents and old-school but easy-to-use layout, wide legroom and seat width for economy class, friendly ground staff service on all airports, and adequately air-conditioned cabin and mood lighting. I arrived early at Haneda but arrived late in Los Angeles, and on the latter flight, the crews just couldn't stop apologizing for the delay, something seemingly textbook when it comes to Japanese culture but very appreciated. When one of my family member's IFE system stopped working, the flight attendant, as a gesture of apology, gave him another form of in-flight entertainment through the very stable in-flight wi-fi. Overall, I would surely try JAL again, and I have never said this before - but I learned a lot from this airline. I hope other airlines can also learn from JAL, too, because I can confidently say without a shadow of a doubt that both flights, SIN-HND and HND-LAX, are my all-time best so far.

11807,Japan Airlines,5.0,"""Food out of Japan is good""",2022-10-24,False,"  New business class Suite III is inferior to the Suite II - the area where your feet / legs go tapers off. So if you are a tall person you are going to struggle to bend to the space. When the seat is not in full decline there is no support under your legs - from the seat to the feet area. This means you are going to be constantly trying to find a comfortable position if working / eating or not in full decline. - when you are partially reclined and have the table down it is quite small. The Suite II seat was superior (especially the window seat) on privacy and just in regards to the actual seat. No issues with the recline position/support or table. The flight attendants aren't trained to look at the list of who is a frequent flyer with their own airline. I am a Diamond flyer (the top frequent flyer status) and still watch in amusement that my Japanese wife gets a 'thank you for joining us again today. Thank you for on-going support'. In the meantime, me, a non-Japanese person, get no acknowledgement at all! (I have only been acknowledged about my status less than five times in all). This time - I got... 'You want the Japanese menu of course - that is why you chose to fly with a Japanese airline right? Is it your first time to Japan?' Ask your cabin crew to check the passenger list of non-Japanese travellers. If they are a JAL frequent flyer - then acknowledge them like you do with the Japanese. On arrival into Japan my flight was late (due to the flight arriving in Sydney late) due to the aircraft having trouble in Japan. I was not assisted to get to the next flight to Osaka even though the later flight had over an hour to go until departure I got that flight is already boarded - a domestic flight boarding an hour before departure? Instead, I was put on the Kansai Osaka flight and arrived at 2am in the morning instead of 8.30pm. Ground crew didn't even try and didn't have a 'can do - let's fix our mistake attitude'. Food out of Japan is good. Out of Sydney, it is not good! The quality is lacking. I recommend the western dish out of Sydney and then the Japanese dish out of Japan. Inflight entertainment  is an old system and the choice is OK for a couple of flights. You will struggle to find choice if going on more than a couple of flights a month.  The technology on the handset is very 2000s. The screen in business and economy are good. WIFI drops in and out - but it is normal on all airlines. Good enough to work and get things done.

They were very hardworking during the flight. I saw them walking around the cabin serving drinks and snacks to passengers who did not sleep between meal services. The toilets were kept really clean throughout the flight. Further, they turned off the personal TV of passengers who have slept to avoid disturbance to other passengers due to the light. Call button was answered within seconds. I sneezed during the flight and one of the crew members immediately popped over and asked if everything was ok and if I needed a blanket or warm water.

The airline is one of the 4 main operators at JFK Terminal One, but it is the only of the 4 that does not have its own lounge at JFK. They offer their premium passengers access to Lufthansa's Senator Lounge instead. Boarding was quite nice and in order, something that I have not seen in Terminal One for a long time. The F Sky Suite was nicely designed and spacious, with ample storage space. Meals were good and nicely presented, as expected from a leading F product. Staff are respectful and accommodating. I picked the Japanese menu but also expressed that I liked caviar, which belonged to the Western menu, and the attendant happily obliged. She also offered to make my bed in the suite across the aisle (the cabin was only half full) so I can continue to use my suite for lounging and the other for sleeping. Such small initiatives made a difference between good and excellent service. It should be noted that, unlike many other first class suites, the Sky Suite does not have a personal closet to hang your clothes. After I changed and exited the WC, an attendant already waited outside with a hanger offering to hang my clothes for me. What a valet service.

Midnight departure so snack bag and water given less than 10 mins after seat belt sign off letting everyone get to sleep. Minimal announcements and big breakfast served 2.5 hours before arrival. Leg room great, toilets always clean, staff very attentive. The Improvements: Seat base is thin and while leg room great I found the seat thin and uncomfortable, Toilets, 3 shared amongst 150 economy and Premium economy pax, so while clean there was always a line.

Hate the Boeing 787 electronic window blinds because they do not get completely dark - on a flight heading west, they do not stop the sun shining into the cabin and heating it up. IFE was OK but not outstanding. Although the crew were great, the food (Japanese set ) was not fresh. The drink service was slow as well which for a flight that is not too long delayed food service and resulted in little time for sleep.

So the plane was late leaving and late arriving in Taiwan. The food was so so, for business class, really it could have been better. Gate staff also were not well organized. It is surprising for Japan. The lack of signs at the airport gate area and the size of the gate area were terrible. Passengers did not know which lines to go to and business and first class passengers also had to fight through the crowd to board. The biggest problem with the flight was a screaming infant across the isle. Flight attendants did nothing. The parents and grandparents also did nothing. It was horrifying. People should not be traveling with infants, period, for any reason unless they are moving abroad! These were typical selfish parents who insist to travel with their family and could careless about other people. The flight was full and their kid was crying the whole time. Which means their kid was not comfortable. This selfishness has to stop, and airline staff and airlines need to address it instead of ignoring it.

First sign of trouble began when we started circling Narita and crew warned us there would be a delay in landing. This made me nervous as my connecting flight to Bangkok was in 1.5 hours. We circled for nearly an hour before the captain came on the intercom and said we were being redirected to Haneda Airport. No reason given, only apology for inconvenience. We landed and refueled, waited another 1.5 hours and took off again, landing at Narita 45 minutes later. No explanation given, just sorry for inconvenience. I ran into the airport, hoping that my connecting flight had waited for me, but it was to no avail. My connecting flight had already left. I had to wait in another line for 2.5 hours to get booked on the first morning flight to BKK, and JAL put me up in a Narita Hotel. I found out that the delay was caused because an earlier aircraft had run off the runway, causing the airport delay. Anyway, bad enough, get on with life. A week later I show up at the airport in Bangkok, and JAL ticket counter informs me my flight has been delayed by 3 hours. Oh hell, not again! Which of course means I cannot catch my connecting flight in Narita again. I ask the reason for the delay, they tell me it's maintenance issue. Wait for over an hour, and to JAL's credit they do book me a flight on EVA air in business class. Thumbs up for that.

I faced three main problems: 1) After a few days of booking, I was informed by JetBlue that my direct flight had been canceled. They also assigned me a new flight which was several hours earlier than my actual departure time from Boston. I contacted the JetBlue helpline and requested to book another flight (the only option for June 10), which wasn’t direct (rather Boston to Florida to Atlanta). 2) During the online boarding process on June 05 and 10, I had to choose a check-in baggage option and was informed that my credit card would not be charged if I had already paid for check-in baggage. I followed the same process on my return flight from Boston to Atlanta. But my credit card was charged $35 for my Atlanta to Boston trip. After a few days, when I looked at my credit card summary, I contacted JetBlue for a refund. They said they would process my request in the next ten days. But contacting JetBlue support was a very frustrating process: wait time was 45 minutes, and it took me over an hour to report the matter to a JetBlue crewmember. 3) The most important and frustrating thing I experienced on June 10 when returning from Boston to Atlanta. The good thing was that JetBlue informed me that I must leave early for the airport because there was some construction work going on in Boston City; therefore, commuting to Boston airport may take longer than usual. My flight was scheduled for 3:45 PM. Therefore, I left for the airport at 12:00 PM. But when I reached the airport, I learned that the departure was delayed for around 35 minutes. The flight kept on delaying, and finally, I learned that I would not be able to catch my 2nd JetBlue flight from Florida to Atlanta if I flew by the original flight from Boston to Florida. I approached the JetBlue helpdesk at Boston Airport. After more than 90 minutes of waiting, I talked to the help desk official. He issued me a new direct ticket (Boston to Atlanta) for the next day. Upon asking, they informed me that I could book a hotel for up to $250. I booked a hotel for an overnight stay in Boston and spent around $240 (I didn’t eat dinner). Then I contacted JetBlue and sent them the invoice. After ten days, I was informed by JetBlue that I was not eligible for reimbursement because the flight was delayed due to the weather. Why was I misguided by the JetBlue agent that I was entitled to a $250 hotel?

The later flight was then delayed further by more than an hour - after much effort, the airline finally agreed to offer a refund (in an email). After I made alternative arrangements and requested the promised refund - the airline went back on it's promise and only refunded half of the ticket price and nothing would make them budge.

12800,Kenya Airways,8.0,"""Nicely done, Kenya Airways""",2022-05-10,True,"  Flew Kigali to Monrovia over Nairobi and Accra on 8-9 May 2022. Flights on time. Checked in online worked well and got my BPs in airport swiftly. No luggage issues. Recognised as Skyteam elite. Kenya Airways staff came to me in lounge and, without request, carried my hand-luggage for me from lounge to the aircraft. No waiting time nor queues anywhere on the trip despite the flights were full or almost full. KQ delivers and have rarely let me down over the years. Pearl Lounge in Kigali delivers but suffers from deprived views of airport runways. First flight was on an Embraer 190 which is a lovely, roomy aircraft. Onboard, they allowed me to shift to an exit row as my original seat was mistakenly occupied by another person. The seat now offered was very nice - it would have cost me 50 USD if booked online. Drinks were generously provided. Appreciate Kenya Airways often have the Happy Hour concept where a request for a single drink most often triggers serving two. The wine in mini-bottles was acceptable, a South African “Stonedale”. I had requested seafood meal and I got it: it was a cold, tasty salmon sandwich. FAs were kind and effective. No IFE nor WiFi but on a 90 minutes flight its not an issue. Transit in Nairobi Airport smooth and quick. It took me only 15 Minutes to reach the KQ Pride Lounge. I love this lounge, roomy and curvy designs with lots of nice sections.

Special meal rendered to perfection. I also tried other dishes as I was offered. Drinks provided generously, again Happy Hour (order 1 get 2) occurred at least once.

12828,Kenya Airways,3.0,"""charge-back process to recover this fee""",2020-05-19,True,"  We flew from JFK to NBO just before the pandemic was declared. This was the first leg of a journey to Seychelles (SEZ). We found the cabin crew on this flight to be excellent, attentive, and really friendly. It seemed that the cabin staff were up and down the aisles very frequently and had a smile on their faces, something that must be tough during these times. We told them how pleased we were at the end of the flight and they seemed genuinely surprised to get the positive feedback. We passed this on to the airline via their website but have received no response as yet. Check in at JFK was easy, but probably atypical due to the reduced number of flyers in early March this year. The same could be said for the boarding process. The plane itself was new, a lovely 787 with mood lighting and big windows. The legroom was reasonable (not cramped but not luxurious). Overall it was comfortable for such a long journey. The food on the outbound journey was really good, way better than we expected, and our son' child's meal was also better than typical kids meals. The biggest negative on our outbound journey was the entertainment system. There were very few recent movies and the choice was extremely limited. Take your tablet or phone and download some eBooks, movies or other entertainment to it. if you are expecting to use the system on the plane to keep you occupied for 14 hours you will be disappointed. If I was rating the airline based on this flight I would actually give this flight 4 or even 5 stars as it was enjoyable but external factors are influencing that rating. Our return journey from Seychelles was delayed overnight by 14 hours and we had to fight to get accommodation. Due to this delay, and the Kenyan government ban on entry for foreigners due to COVID-19, it also meant our mini KQ Safari booked through the airline had to be cancelled. This is all very understandable and we have no issue with any of that. We cancelled this over email with the safari division while in the Seychelles and assumed there would be no issue. However, despite meeting 3 of the criteria needed for refund I am now going through a VISA charge-back process to recover this fee. First they say to talk to travel agent (when we booked the safari directly through them on a different credit card number) and then they say its valid for a year and they do not refund services .. despite having a clear statement on their website that a refund can be done if you fit 1 of the 3 criteria - 1. contact the email provided within 24 hours of the safari to cancel (we did it 6 days before), 2. Have a flight cancellation or delay (we were cancelled and put on a flight 14 hours later), and 3. Being denied entry to the country (the government were denying foreign nationals even with a visa - which we had). We want to go back to the Seychelles when all this is over but sadly I fear it will need to be with another airline, despite the stellar service of the staff on KQ003 on the day we flew.",Boeing 787,Family Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Seychelles via Nairobi ,3.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,no,March,2020

The flight was delayed by around one hour, it was the infamous day of July 5-6 where Schiphol had a severe storm that caused the delay and cancellation of hundreds of flights. Ours was luckily delayed only by one hour because the flight before departed later from Amsterdam. Boarding was not done using zones. People started gathering around the gate standing around 20 minutes before boarding even started. I The flight itself was pretty chill, the crew was very professional and comforting. The breakfast that was given was fruit salad, yogurt and a hot drink. It was okay for an early morning flight. Landing at Schiphol was smooth. My only complaint would be the width of Economy class seats. I am no small person, but also not super large. And yet I found that the seats were really narrow even for thinner people than me. It felt as my hands could only go on the table or that I would need to cross them, in order not to touch the other person. Also seats were lacking padding, they were pretty thin. After one hour of seating my tail bone started aching, and I had to move in my seat every 30 minutes and change my position.

12880,KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,8.0,"""Value for money""",2023-05-04,True," Flew CPH-AMS-KGL with KLM 3rd May 2023 on B737-800 and A330-200 aircrafts, respectively. Ticket bought from Ticket.com and easily handled online on KLMs homepage. Check-in online with success, but it does not reduce check-in time in Airport, so it just wastes time. Luggage checked in the whole way and delivered perfectly in Kigali. Seat choice functions well and is free to Flying Blue (elite) card holders. As both flights became almost full, I had to change my seats accordingly; eventually I got a (5 cm only) more spacious “Economy Comfort” seat which almost reassembles “Premium Economy”, which is a class higher. On the short haul I picked a declinable exit seat and had the whole row to myself. Lounges in Copenhagen (Aviator, 2 choices) and in Amsterdam (4 choices) are both nice and provide excellent breakfast. They open as early as 5 am, which made use possible. In the KLM Lounge 52 in Amsterdam, there is a new hype with their extremely popular Mimosa drink (champagne with 25% orange juice, blended, not stirred). Full catering service onboard on both flights, even the short haul to Amsterdam. FAs were good and energetic, particularly on the short haul. On the long haul, however, some cabin crew tend to patronise the passengers. Onboard supplies are quite sparse, unless one pushes. Call buttons are only answered after long time waits. Long haul rendered 2 hot meal services, but the food is not good, apart from the starters (Mediterranean Mezze). I tried both main dishes offered at lunch and they were both disappointing. They offer hot and soft drinks but also Heineken and (cheap) wines onboard; however, the red wine is somehow good (Shiraz from South Africa). I brought along my own glasses as I refrain drinking from paper mugs. Cutlery is made of wood. IFE (only longhaul) is good; bring your own headset. Conclusion: Recommended. All flights on time. Value for money. As usual, luggage was handled correct. Catering is clearly subpar compared to other legacy carriers. Big advantage to be frequent flyer, especially elite, which allow for amble seat choice and fills you up in the lounges prior to be airborne.","Boeing 737-800, A330-200",Business,Economy Class,Copenhagen to Kigali via Amsterdam,4.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,yes,May,2023

I have no idea how it is rated a four star airline. We departed on time at 3am. The staff in India were not friendly. The seats are rather uncomfortable. My audio wasn’t working properly. No pillows are provided despite it being a 10 hour night flight. The service starts with only a hot pocket and drink. No alcohol on board the flight for economy class.

12929,KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,2.0,"""really poor service level by KLM""",2023-01-09,True,"  Working as an expat in Malaysia, KLM offers the most convenient flight route between Kuala Lumpur and Stavanger, Norway via Amsterdam. Booking flight tickets is an easy and straight forward matter, the same can not be told when it comes to selecting seating for the flights. I am a frequent traveler and a father of four wonderful children. I have been travelling with infant numerous times between Europe and South America (KLM, Brasil) and between Europe and Asia (Scandinavian Airlines, Thai Airways, Lufthansa), and it has never been a problem getting an infant bassinet - until now. When purchasing the tickets, I always follow up by talking with a real human to ensure my request for an infant bassinet is registered in the booking. I then repeat the request upon check-in as soon as it opens (typically a day before departure, depending on destination). KLM has not delivered on our 3 last intercontinental flights, leaving us with an infant on our laps for 14 hour flights. All the while, we can see the seats where infant bassinets can be utilized are occupied with passengers not travelling with infants. Children grow quickly, and I doubt we will have more children. As such, this is a temporary problem for us. Regardless, I think it is really poor service level by KLM not to make an effort to facilitate infant bassinet requests better than what they have demonstrated on our last 3 intercontinental flights.",Boeing 777-200ER,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Kuala Lumpur to Stavanger via Amsterdam,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,no,November,2022

Later in the flight, a warm pastry was service -  mostly a thick soggy dough with some trace of a bland, unrecognizable and unappetizing substance inside.

When my trip ended and time to return to Bahrain, I was refused to board the airplane just because of my nationality. At that time Kuwait government banned Chinese citizens from entering Kuwait due to corona-virus pandemic, which i totally understand. But Kuwait government did not mention anything regarding transit passenger. Besides, I hadn't travelled to China since August 2019, and I had been living in Bahrain since the pandemic began.  When the airline refused my trip they mentioned it was a rule from the Kuwait government and they could not provide another trip with another airline to me. So I was abandoned by them, stranded in Bangkok with nowhere to go for a night, and had to buy another ticket to return to Bahrain. Since then I tried to request a refund and an apology, but they only replied once to my email saying the ticket can be rebooked with normal rebooking policy and charges may apply.

During boarding, it was a bit chaotic. There is no structured line dividers or anything. It was a big confusion trying to board, and rather tedious. The second was our seat arrangements. We had already reserved a seat online while booking, but when boarding, the agent suddenly changed my seat and my parents seats. We got in the plane, and then 30 mins later a flight attendant asked us if we can switch our seats with this guy who had children. Apparently she can’t seat children by the exit, and that’s fine. But this needed to be sorted out by the airline beforehand. Most importantly, the meals are based by the seat numbers. So when we changed seats like 2 times, we almost got the wrong meals. We had to tell the flight attendant our selected meal preference during the booking, otherwise we would’ve received the wrong meals. I mean it’s a service we paid for. The food was decent though.  It was an alright flight for the price of the tickets. However, I’d probably avoid this airline if I could.

IFE had a small selection of movies, cabin Crew extremely rude and unprofessional. Ground Staff rude and unhelpful. Transfer experience at Kuwait is confusing and difficult. Kuwait Airport lacks many facilities common in most international airports Review: I initially booked this flight because it was the cheapest option to Dubai, around $60 cheaper than the competition; big mistake. I did not have a single flight with Kuwait, either on my way to Dubai or back that was on time. From JFK, my flight was delayed for 3 hours, causing me to miss my connection to Dubai. They put us in a Hotel on Airport property, which, although had a good view of the apron, was a sub-par hotel. The ground staff do not know how to do their job correctly. They are rude, and the airport lacks proper signage. You are bussed around from terminal to terminal with no real staff presence to guide you. We almost missed our flight to JFK because the gate was labeled Mumbai, so we didn't know that it was intended for New York. Kuwait Airport doesn't even seem qualified to be a domestic airport, lacking proper signage and two distant terminals which you're bussed around in. Ground crew does not care about you, and show no interest or courtesy when dealing with you. The same can be said with the cabin crew. They are rude, and do not know how to treat passengers. The meal timings are horrible, as they leave many passengers extremely hungry for long hours on the plane, and water service is extremely selective. You'd think an airline knows when to give out water and food. They also gave us no details about our stop in Shannon on our way back to JFK and could not be seen for much of the flight. The only good part about the flight was the legroom, which was spacious. However, that is not a reason for booing Kuwait over any other competent airline.

Total 20.5 hours. Seems like the crew is not trained to help customers with the connecting flights and I experienced further delays so I missed my connecting flight. Also they do two stopovers coming from Mumbai, but you are told only about one. They jerk you and are not truthful about who to contact to try to help you. At JFK airport the Kuwait Airways staff said they are not responsible for me missing my flight, even though the flight was late.

16611,Qatar Airways,8.0,"""Award booking took weeks to book""",2023-03-13,True,"  The perks of flying First with QR is the lounges and onboard tranquility. The rest is nothing special. Even using my miles I would refrain to use them on 1st unless I had to forego them. Their excellent business class makes 1st class almost superfluous. The product is conservative, amazing space, and care level as the pax desires. QR markets their 1st class as a “relish the myriad of exclusive offerings”. Business class is similar (better?) and provides better value for the money. A single spoon of Pearl caviar doesn’t make it. The original can was displayed upon request. Sparkling wines in First are expensive, branded Rare and Alexandra (both ex. 2006), but Business has 2 fine champagnes, which are cheaper and good.  The interior of cabin is dull, conservative, with brownish un-inspirational colors. Access to Bar is fine but not only a 1st Class privilege. Tried to preselect food for weeks before flying but it does not work from my departing cities. Could not  access a menu in advance. Lounges, food, space, and service is better than business class. Welcome champagnes on board; given kit and a quality pyjamas. Champagnes served are truly expensive in contrast to the meagre, cheap, industrial sub-quality beers they could offer. Leffe was the least poor. On QR, I have never been able to get an IPA or porter beer. Food not much better than business class, a spoon of Pearl caviar and a deshelled, dry lobster hand does not make the justification nor significant difference.  Had hoped for some outstanding food, but it was close to ordinary. IFE fine big screen. Ground and Luggage: QR has ground handling problems. They refused to relabel my bags to final destination. Staff disregarded QR’s partnership with Rwandair, resulting me to lose my luggage transfer to final destination. Neither QR in Doha nor in BKK were willing to fix it. However, Rwandair fixed it eventually and opted to board me but leaving my bags 2 days behind in Doha before next flight to Kigali. Had to accept. Partnerships with Rwandair has problems of non-aligned systems, separate bookings, BPs not issued reversely, luggage transfer failures, no full lounge access reciprocality. BOOKING Very hard to come around vacant award seats in F, so I had to plan an entire journey around a leg found (BKK-DOH) to accommodate it. Award booking with QR took weeks to book, coordinate, manage, and process. Exacerbated by the fact that my QR booking had to fit into another QR award booking with a partner airline (Rwandair).

Crew members: Rude and ignoring passengers. They didn't provide water after asking twice. Even pressing the assist button didn't help. Blankets were not provided on boarding. You had to ask for blankets. During my Kuwait to Shannon flight I asked the air hostess to provide a blanket, she responded ""we are running out of the blankets"".

Firstly the entertainment system is totally useless, an entire 8 hour flight without entertainment. Also 30 minutes before landing the Samsung tablets were turned off so we couldn't track our progress coming into land. The plane was filthy (we flew from Paris, which is their base airport so you would think extra care would be taken in cleaning) my partners so called clean blanket had clumps of hair all over it, there was crumbs around my seat and there was dust all around my seat. The food was passable at best. Although I have had better food on a short haul economy flight. The cabin crew crew service was poor, although friendly. Apart from the dinner service the service was almost non-existent. Apart from dinner the crew never asked us if we wanted any drinks and we felt awkward in asking for one. Also the crew seemed to ignore our call button, which was extremely infuriating. We were in the air almost 1 hour before beig offered a proper drink. The seats were OK in comfort but once made into a bed they were rather uncomfortable. They are not lay flat, with your legs being in a much lower position creating a very odd sleeping position. The toilets were horrendous as halfway through the flight one decided to stop flushing creating a very nasty surprise for all those who dare venture in. I found the flight to be extremely disappointing. In my view this is not a business class airline but a premium economy airline with extra legroom.

Overall, great experience both ways across the Atlantic. Both flights departed and arrived on time. Check in was a breeze at both airports and you can't beat the priority boarding. The lounge in Newark was better than the one in Paris. The Paris lounge was crowded with little selection on food and drinks. Once on board, the flight attendants were polite and friendly even with my crazy toddler. The food was okay and the Seats were comfy. The slight angle wasn't an issue for getting rest. For this price, this value can't be beat and I would definitely fly them again for pleasure or business.

Our experience was very positive (I do wonder what some people expect sometimes). The lounge at Luton Airport is not on par with Virgin lounges at Heathrow or Gatwick, and Luton airport serves charter and low cost flights. There was some upgrade work taking place when we flew out which was a little noisy, and the lounge was somewhat full as it accepts Priority Pass holders but we found a seat and it was adequate for our needs. Check in was smooth and painless with the advantage of using a priority security clearance lane, where everybody was polite and jolly which was a pleasant change. We were called to the gate from the lounge just before boarding with the gate being a short walk from the lounge. We were offered drinks before take off - cranberry juice with or without champagne and handed amenity kits which contained all the basics (socks, eye mask, earplugs, toothbrush and toothpaste, moisturiser etc) - again I have read criticisms in some reviews. The cabin crew on both trips were extremely polite and attentive (both legs had empty seats which is a bit of a concern because I hope La Compagnie are successful with the Luton to Newark route). The Captain was very jolly, again a nice touch. All the food I tried was delicious - we had one gluten free meal and one regular. A small basket of ""snacks"" was put out for anybody who had room for nibble during the outbound flight (mars bars, kit-kats, haribos) but I didn't notice anything similar on the return (everybody was sleeping so probably not required). It took me a while to get the hang of the seat positioning controls, but I find my mobile difficult to get to grips with. The bed doesn't lie flat completely horizontally but I was still able to sleep (I put my back and a spare pillow at the foot of the seat to raise my legs a little). I liked using the tablet and whilst the latest block busters were missing, I was able to keep myself entertained with the films which were available (and I loaded a couple to my iPad just in case but didn't really need them). Even Newark customs security was having a good day - within 20 minutes of landing we were waiting for our car in the arrivals hall. The lounge a Newark on the flight home is before security but does not present a problem. You can get a hot meal but the nibbles are very limited. Again we were called to our flight by the staff in the lounge and it only took about 10 mins to get through security (a much less jolly experience than Luton!) after the short walk from the lounge.

AKL-SYD leg was slightly better crew. The service crew behaviour was cold.  The cabin staff disappeared in the pantry for almost 20 minutes - there was no pre-meal drinks service unless requested.  Although biz class was only 70% full, they seemed peeved by anyone ordering the standard full meal and breakfast (vs. an express option), the main of veal and semolina arrived cold, only a choice of one of each of whiskey, rum, vodka but the choice of Argentinian or Chilean wine was better.

Although the LAN web site indicated that you should report to check-in a whole 3 hours before scheduled departure time, I decided to play it cool and only arrive at the Santiago airport at 7.00 for a 8.30 am. flight, just to see that check-in was still well in progress, without any rush. Upon boarding the Boeing 787 I just loved the cabin interior: very light and roomy with nice LED lights around. When finding my seat, I soon realised however, how small it was. I’m sure is the narrowest airplane seat I’ve ever seen and the legroom was very short for someone of 181 cm. I was happy that I was only going to spend 6 hours and not 12 on this plane! However, I soon found the IFE which offered a great selection of top recent films, certainly far too many for this six hours flight. As I hadn't downloaded the LAN application on my tablet beforehand, there would have been even a greater choice of entertainment available for this flight. Soon after take-off, an excellent breakfast with fresh fruit and an omelette was served. During the rest of the flight, drinks and coffee were served several times. The best part of this flight was however the Chilean LAN cabin crew. The steward serving my section was chatting around, making jokes and asking several times, if I needed something more.

Unfortunately when we got to the hotel the hotel had no rooms and they claimed LATAM never confirmed any of the bookings with them. LATAM was unreachable to resolve this problem. We tried on social media channels and five different phone numbers. Basically all of us were left to fend for ourselves. Ultimately secured my own room at another hotel and got myself there. Zero chance of being reimbursed by LATAM who refuses to respond to my queries on Twitter. At GRU was told there is not one person who could help resolve this despite it being a hub airport - they said I have to call them - we tried multiple times with no success. They have been completely unresponsive since the problem has occurred and their customer service is less than zero. Their lack of competence is outdone only by their lack of integrity. As for the flight itself, their B767 product is antiquated, circa 1990 in look and feel, badly in need of refurbishment. Seats uncomfortable, 2x2x2 configuration offer no privacy. IFE did not work properly and hardware was falling apart. Business class headphones were the same cheap plastic as economy and they had some dog ate the homework excuse as to why they didn't have the noise cancelling or noise reducing variety that made no sense. Needless to say I'd avoid LATAM and this aircraft for all of said reasons unless you absolutely need to fly them.

We assumed that this would a good flight as well. Well, we couldn't be further from the truth, with that statement. Boarding was a bit confusing, yet they did get that sorted. Our flight had taken off with a slight 30-minute delay, due to a mechanical issue that they originally claimed would take a few hours to fix. They were about to take us off the plane, but the captain said that there was no further problem, and we can continue normally. After about one hour into the flight, we were told that a stabilizer was not ‘retracting’ completely. This was creating ‘drag’ on the aircraft, which was burning more fuel than expected. It would not give us enough fuel to reach our destination safely (Spanish coastline), and potentially run out of fuel. The captain turned the plane around and landed safely back at Boston Logan International Airport. Our original point of departure. We were all relieve that we landed safely. After arriving at the gate, the cabin crew as well as the remaining staff for the airline, remained silent. As if they were instructed to say nothing. We had no instructions or direction from any of the staff. Everyone from the flight proceeded to the ticket counter, to try and find out if there was any information available about rebooking, or if this flight would go back out tonight. Since it was already close to midnight, there was a strong sense that we would not be flying out at all. All the staff would tell us is, that we would receive an 'e-mail' with further instructions. (Which we never received.) The passengers that were there, including ourselves, had to figure out which baggage claim to retrieve our luggage. There was no assistance offered by the airline staff at all. Once we gathered our luggage, we arrange for a car service to bring us home. Luckily we were about 15 minutes away from the airport. Most of the passengers there were stranded and had nowhere to go. Finding out a day later we made the news. This airline has the worst communication skills that I have ever experienced in the 40+ years of flying. This is the 'SPIRIT' of Spain. Poorly organized and poorly managed. They are an example of what an airline should not be. Researching further, they cancel over 50% of their flights. They consistently blame someone else out of convenience. When calling Iberia, they would be helpful at first. But then when trying to get onto another flight that they had transferred us onto, the itinerary was wrong. We would miss all connecting flights.

The two hour delay ""for operational reasons"" was expected however with no notification of the delay until you reach the airport always makes things frustrating. The biscuits and water for the children helped pass the time. However, when boarding, we all felt claustrophobic and short of breath. There seemed to be no air conditioning and the temperature in the airplane had each of us sweating profusely with most travellers only getting relief from using safety cards to fan themselves. Towards the end of the short flight it did really seem that we were cooking in the aircraft. Relief was only felt when getting outside the back door to get some fresh cool air.

13991,LOT Polish Airlines,2.0,"""nobody wanted to reschedule our still valid tickets""",2023-01-05,False,"  We flew several years with LOT. There was nothing special, a lot of small delays caused by the not optimal organisation at Warsaw Airport (for example only 1 stairs instead of 2, which results in longer boarding & deboarding). Problems started as we had 4 tickets for us and other family members in 2021, as LOT Polish Airlines cancelled the connection. We were promised by the call centre agent of LOT that we can use these tickets when LOT starts to fly this route again, instead of refund. LOT was very happy that we didn´t want our money back due to the financial situation in Covid times. As they started to fly again in August 2022 nobody wanted to reschedule our still valid tickets. Surprising was the attitude, how call agents treat customers: arrogantly and dismissive. At first they wanted the conversation log, but as we gave them all this details, they suddenly stopped answering. We had a nice employee, who understood our feelings and wanted to help, promised a call back, but he never called again. We booked our tickets via online travel service so LOT refuses to pay as the amount back. But: due to EU Commission regulations LOT has to refund the full amount, independently of the place of purchase. Finally the situation is as follows: The online agency charges per person 40 Euro while refund = 80 Euro per ticket = 160 Euro per 2 tickets.

After finished meal service, almost lights in passengers’ area were turned off for making passengers feel comfortable to fall asleep. In the situation, I needed water and have pushed calling crew button. However, any crew didn’t come and check me. It has been turned crew calling light on more than 30 minutes. (The calling crew light was bright on still.) Actually, I could see crews’ area from my seat. Even though passenger is calling crew, they were just talking each other and never check passengers’ area. That seems they just enjoy the quiet time. I know I could visit crews’ area and ask them to give me a cup of water. However, other passenger was sleeping on my next seat. I didn’t want to wake him wake up. Therefore I was just waiting for the crew comes to me and help. After 30 minutes, this plane faced to turbulence and seat belts sign were on. Finally, crew came out from crews’ area. It was just for locking toilet. When the crew was going back, I said “Excuse me” loudly for calling her. She didn’t check me, even though some passengers woke up because of my loud voice. Therefore I shout “Excuse me” little bit more loudly again. Then, she came to me and asked to help. I was so mad in that time.

Long story short flight was overbooked and agents used easy targets such as my daughter who is a minor, and to that polite one, and wouldn’t stand up for herself or doesn’t quite know her rights. After numerous phone calls to the airlines they did put her on the flight right before it had taken off. Not a pleasant experience at all.

14017,LOT Polish Airlines,3.0,"""I wouldn't book again""",2022-09-06,True,"  I was required to go to the checkin counter to get paper boarding passes even though I was not checking bags. After waiting over an hour, I learned that the line was so long because they were telling everyone that they could not have a carryon and a personal item (they claimed that this was the airline's policy, not because the plane was full). I showed them where it said it was allowed on the website and they ignored me. We then had to repack our personal item in order to check our carryons. This was why the line was taking so long, everyone has to do this. This whole process took over an hour and a half and I got through security just before our flight started boarding (I arrived 3 hours in advance). On the first flight (Tel Aviv to Warsaw on 737-800), the cabin crew were not so nice, and for a 3.5 hour flight, they gave out options for water, sparkling water, tea, and coffee. They also gave out a large snack but didn't have a kosher option even though I ordered a kosher meal with my reservation. They then sold other products like Pepsi and potato chips that would be free on most airlines. The in flight wifi to watch movies with that could be used instead of an IFE screen (this plane did not have screens) stopped working after we pushed back from the gate. The in flight PAs were not very understandable in English. We had to wait about half an hour after we parked when we landed in order for busses to come and pick us up. Connecting through Warsaw: airport doesn't have a lot of outlets or comfy seating and you have to go through security and/or passport control. On the second flight (Warsaw to New York JFK on Boeing 787-9), the cabin crew (or at least the flight attendant primarily serving my area of the plane) was really nice. The drinks selection was again poor, but this time included a few juices and sodas, but didn't have anything like coke or sprite. The kosher meals provided were good, but there were no kosher snacks given throughout the flight. The flight attendants we're constantly offering water which was really nice, but I would've liked it if they collected garbage a bit more often because that's difficult to deal with as a window seat passenger like I was. The IFE on this flight was amazing (compared to every other IFE I've seen in my life). It was super responsive and had a large selection of movies. The TV selections were slim (for example there were some shows that they only had 4 episodes of) but I enjoyed it and didn't find it frustrating to use. Probably the most annoying thing about this flight was that they made an announcement telling us how we could buy all this duty free stuff on the plane, but the announcement took like 10 minutes and it paused our IFE screens (and we had to listen to it in Polish and English). The seat comfort was reasonable for long haul economy. Two other things to note about this flight was that the cabin crew set the windows to 50% brightness (you couldn't make it go higher) even though it was a day flight, and the USB port I used to charge my phone kept turning off for fractions of a second at a time, which was fine for me but I could see would get annoying for someone with a phone that vibrates and/or makes a sound when it starts charging. Once we arrived at the airport, the bags took around 45 minutes to show up on the baggage claim. All in all, for long haul flights, once you're on the plane it's good, but I wouldn't book again unless I'm saving thousands of dollars.",Boeing 737-800 / 787-9,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Tel Aviv to New York JFK via Warsaw,3.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,no,September,2022

My flight out of Chicago was delayed over 6hrs and they didn’t have a gate agent there until halfway through delay to provide any info and help with re-booking, even when she came she was useless. Didn’t provide any water or snacks either and most airports concessions were closed. Same for customer service on phone, you wait 2hrs to talk to someone and when you do they are not helpful and even yell at you. Coming back to Chicago same experience, waited for baggage for 3 hours after an almost 10 hour flight with a little one and when it did not show up, can’t find any of their representatives to help out with filing a claim and tracking where it is.

LG is among the last legacy carriers providing a meal on their “medium-long” flights. Nevertheless, a hot meal instead of a cold one would be preferred in this case. The cabin crew was professional but not exceptional. As I said previously, there was a complete lack of English announcements on board. This is simply unacceptable. Additionally, Spanish announcements would be a nice touch too. Nevertheless, it seems like Luxair doesn’t really care about this issue. No invitation for the web check-in and no miles can be earned on the LUX-AGP/AGP-LUX routes. Yet again, something unacceptable.

One of the biggest critic I could make though i’d the lack of any English and Portuguese announcements made by the crew during the entire flight. This is really not acceptable for a legacy company such as Luxair.

This makes check-in at the airport very long as everyone is required to go to the registration desks (there’s no self check-in machines for Luxair at Faro airport neither). Ground announcements for boarding were only made in French. Some Portuguese passengers had to ask the Portway handling crew to clarify what was going on as the 3 different groups were called for boarding, each at different times. Same for the flight and same thing as always; there’s a lack of English announcements, and even Portuguese announcements (even though all LG flights to LİS and OPO have them; not sure about Madeira flights though). The crew was of Portuguese decent but all announcements were made in LU, FR and DE. This is truly not acceptable for a legacy airline. The meal served on board was good, although the quantity was pretty small. A hot meal would be more than welcome instead of a cold one.

Things have changed with years and the quantity of the of the breakfast served on board is very small compared to what it used to be. Another fact to underline as for other LG destinations, the LACK OF ENGLİSH announcerments (there was a few American passengers onboard who did not sparks any of the 3 official languages of Luxembourg) and also Portuguese.

Our flight was delayed 6 hours- received an email saying my flight was updated, but no change to flight departure. Sat in the airport in Toronto from 6 am until 1 pm. Then we were taxied around for about 35 minutes to the plane, where we sat for another 1 hour. Seat assignment was only for some people - the lady sitting beside me did not have an assigned seat, but upon check in my fiancé and I were told we must have an assigned seat. Be consistent. We checked a bag- they lost the bag. The guy checking it in did not care at all about us checking in (he also knew about the delay but didn’t say anything). When we found out where the bag was lost, turns out he didn’t put it in place to actually be delivered to be on the plane. It didn’t leave Toronto. He also could not figure out how to check it in, so just said it’s free, rather than following steps. No wonder it was lost. Upon arriving, we couldn’t find anyone from Lynx to find out where our bag was. Staff left. We dealt with someone from another airline. Upon checking in to come home: spent 2 hours on hold, to only give up assuming they were not staffed (a 15 minute wait time was a bit ridiculous to be 2 hours and counting). We called the next morning, within 2 minutes of opening- took 45 minutes to speak to an agent, who told us we didn’t have a return flight and wouldn’t look into it. He literally said, I’m not sure figure it out. Upon getting boarding passes, we had to pay to check in our carry on - we did not on the way here? Flight was delayed again.

With past experience, the airline was world renowned for its hospitality. This turn to the worst during my recent trip with the airlines. Check in with the airline was seamless thanks to the efficiency of the ground staff and security personnel. Once boarded, we were greeted with friendly smiles from the cabin crew as we walked to our seat. Once the plane started taxing to the runway, things changed. The crew somewhat became more hostile and there was a lot of confusion going on in the flight. The were aggressive in their tone and acted in a way that was way off from their marketing self proclaimed Malaysian Hospitality. For the confusion part, there was a son and mother seating at the opposite of us, and another lady which was assigned to the window seat. As the mother required a slightly bigger space, the on checked with the lady and the cabin crew before taxi if the lady would mind to shift seats. The lady agreed and guided by the cabin crew to another seat. Upon lift off, the lady was seen walking aimlessly throughout the aisle and she mentioned another cabin crew chased her back as the front seat is Premium Economy and she is not entitled to be there.  Another cabin crew then approached and raised her voice to ask her why is the lady shifting seats, and it took some time for the crew to understand that they messed up. During meals, the trays are pushed to you as thought they were waiting for ages for you to take the tray from them. The crew seems to not be bothered that it was a night flight as most passengers were sleeping, hence during service, there would take some time to adjust to the surrounding instead of abruptly asking what do they want to eat.

Malindo replied that my tickets were bought “under promotional offer” and they are unreturnable so all I can get back is tax thad I had paid. Well, the point is that my tickets weren’t “super saver” but “value”. I had bought them through official website plus I had purchased extra luggage so I don’t understand how come my tickets became promotional and nonrefundable. At some point, they just started ignoring my e-mails. How professional is that? I am not happy the way they dealt with this situation. I’m truly offended by the way the company treated me.

Arrived at the airport with literally no line with ground staff asking for details regarding my visa and return flight as I would leave the country via another airline. Flight was delayed by about 40 minutes upon departure. The cabin crew were very friendly and the cabin itself was nicely decorated with some xmas decorations. The legroom however was very very poor and definitely less than most LCC carriers. On board wifi available to use their app and some content on their app, but very limited.

The check-in at the airport for both flights were uneventful, efficiently handled and most notably, having little or no queues, which is always a welcomed sight when there are snaking queues at neighbouring counters for other airlines. The boarding for the outgoing flight started a little after the scheduled time. The planes do not have any seat-back entertainment units but for the outgoing flight, there was onboard wifi which allow you free access to a selection of movies and TV shows on the MAI app which can be pre-loaded onto phones, Ipads, etc. The selection was limited.

As soon as cruising altitude was reached the flight attendants moved quickly down the 2-2 cabin with pastries, then returned to serve tea/coffee, with lollies during descent.

14930,Myanmar National Airlines,7.0,"""enjoy it for a 2.5 hour flight""",2016-08-15,False,"  I traveled Yangon to Singapore return in economy. They have an eight seats Business class session but it was not occupied on outbound. Up to row 8 is premium economy but the same kind of seat as economy. Boarding was swift on both flight. Cabin ambience was nice and greeted by crew in colourful dresses. Male crew wore blue suit. Seat was ok for me but will have problem for tall and slightly larger passenger. Both flights probably have only like 60% load factor. Safety video was very informative and done in Burmese which could surprise foreigners who had never been on a flight before. However, the English run was done after the Burmese so all is good. Meal service started after seat belt signs was off. SIN-RGN starts with a drink service and a coffee run after meal but RGN-SIN went straight into meal. UB001 was two choice noodles and friend rice. My neighbour chose noodles but the crew did not have it and said will return but never did. When tray was collected the same crew pretend it did not happen. The meal was small and not delicious. SIN-RGN has a choice of chicken and fish curry rice. I chose chicken and it was surprising good meal. The vegetables were surprisingly fresh and nicely cooked. Mood lighting is also part of this new aircraft so it was a comfortable cabin to be in. My travel was during the monsoon so the flight was a bit bumpy but not to the point where they have to stop the inflight service. They also provide duty free shopping but on both flight the MNA plane model was out of stock. They have power supply in seat and in flight entertainment through wifi service was good but limited materials.

14933,NAM Air,4.0,"""price for baggage didn't make sense""",2020-01-02,True,"  Denpasar to Yogyakarta. I chose NAM Air because no other airline flew from Denpasar to Jogjakarta that evening and that would be a new experience for me.  Thinking that the price of over baggage will be affordable as I read (through several website in Google) that the range is between 15.000 - 81.000 depending on the distance, so I decided to check all of my suitcases. I went to the check in counter, the CS was friendly enough. After showing my ID, and mentioning my destination, the staff weighed my bags, it turned out that they are over baggage - the maximum weight is 15 kg and the total weight of my bags is 30 kg. Then, the customer said that, the price for over baggage is 100.000 per kilogram. Therefore, I needed to pay 1.5 million for those bags. Well, my ticket was 1 million so I thought that the price for my over baggage didn't make any sense. Eventually, I decided to check only one bag and brought the small baggage into cabin. Still, I had to pay 700.000 for my baggage. That's very expensive compared to another airlines. At that time, the staff didn't accept card payment so that I had to withdraw some money from ATM machine. The check in process went smoothly (except for those weird baggage policy). The flight schedule was on-time, not many passengers on the plane that evening, maybe only 1/3 of airplane were filled. No bus, so the staff took us to the plane by minibus (better than walking though, but the other passengers must wait for the minibus since they only operated one). The plane was old - the interior atmosphere was not that fresh, however, the flight quality as good. As soon as the passengers arrived on the place, the FA distributed some candies. We also had bread and small mineral water. It's under my expectation, noticing the amount of money that I've paid for the flight. Since, I was so tired after having a long flight, then I just let it go and slept during the flight. The flight went smoothly though despite the plane 'age'. I arrived on-time, I also got my baggage faster less than 10 minutes after arrival. However, the problem appeared, the tag code in my bag was different to what I have in my ticket (although they share the same name) so that the staff stopped me for a while for further investigation. Another staff came and checked my bag, and let me go. Still, lot of people staring at me - thinking that I might take somebody's suitcase. For security reason,I know that it is good to check the baggage codes, but the staffs must be trained of what to do in case the same situation happens - not just keep questioning or blaming the customer because of having different codes.",B737-500,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Denpasar to Yogyakarta,2.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,December,2019

Food and drink were available but nothing special. Flight boarded on-time to one of their newer A320's, friendly welcome from flight attendants and I liked the aircraft interior - the bulkhead had pictures of Mt Everest on it. Business class seats looked nice but that section was empty. Coach was pretty full but a few open rows in the front. Coach flight attendants were friendly and served drinks and a good meal once in flight for the 1 hour 15 minutes in the air. The toilets were busy so some people went to business class toilet and were literally chased out by the business class flight attendant. She was horrible - she was just sitting up there doing nothing - not even helping the coach attendants do their drink runs. It was nothing to let people use that front toilet.

The inbound flight was okay, web check in worked like a charm once I called Etihad to see why I can't check in with them, and they pointed me to FlyNiki. One suitcase got devastated (no wheels left in Abu Dhabi) but they are not to blame. The problem came with the return flight. I tried checking in as usual on their website, tried the confirmation number first and got error: customer not found. Then I decided to try the tickets and lucky me, I got checked in. This however was not the case for my family. Every time I tried checking them in I got customer not found. I have tried contacting them the very same night with no success (their Abu Dhabi toll free number doesn't work). Finally gave up and contacted them via the online form (after almost 30 minutes of struggling with the thing). Next day I woke up and tried all the numbers I could find - Abu Dhabi airport, Etihad, Toll free number (all of these cost money to call) with no success. Not knowing if my family even had a chance of flying I contacted the hotel's concierge, who was lucky enough to get me through to AirBerlin. Now comes the funny part: the guy on the line confirmed all tickets are valid but I wasn't checked in, nor had any other passenger on the flight. The flight was empty. So I asked him if we go to the airport and check in there, would it be possible to get seated one next to each other (at least my wife and the kid). He said it's not a problem. Going to the airport the flight turned out to be full and it was only because of the kindness of the Etihad staff that we got adjacent seats. The thing that angered me the most was they did answer the contact form on their site 2 hours before the flight saying: We also want to inform you that for this reservation wasn't made any check-in for any of the tickets. The airport has already took control over the tickets so a check-in directly at the airport will be necessary.

The screen was just above my head and the next screen was too far away, so they were pretty useless. On the positive side, they give you a sandwich and a small glass to drink.

I flew over with Virgin in June and paid £740 including 3 meals and 3 cases and a nice spacious economy seat. The meal that cost £30 was abysmal, wasn't filling and for that money too!

The introductory fares were so cheap that the flight for my family of five came to around the same price as a single return on a direct flight to London with a legacy carrier. We flew MCO to Oslo, spent a night, flew to LON then back through Oslo to MCO two weeks later. The flight was on a brand new aircraft, we did the basic ticket packs, (no food, assigned seating or baggage). I don’t like eating on night flights east, and happy to a la carte on the way back. Flight took off and landed on time, spotlessly clean, good food and entertainment.  CEO managing check in on return leg was a nice touch too!

15210,Norwegian,1.0,"""they refused to provide a refund""",2023-07-05,True,"  The complaint concerns the booking system with Norwegian Airlines. The issue is the option for baggage in the hold. It must be noted we are fully familiar with modern on-line booking systems and e-tickets. At no point did we order 2 suitcases for the hold. We contacted customer service and they refused to provide a refund and informed us those were the rules. This equated to an additional €50 on top of our flight cost with no possible recourse. I wonder if hackers have manipulated their booking system to help jack-up company revenues. On this basis I would recommend people to be very careful when booking with Norwegian and take note that sometimes ""Possession is 9 tenths of the Law"".",Boeing 737,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Manchester to Copenhagen,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,July,2023

I have always flown British Airways. I understand why long haul flights are and can be so expensive, nonetheless I try to get the best price possible for a direct flight. I couldn't believe my luck to find out that a prestigious airline was providing a direct flight from the closest airport to me (1 hour away), and less than half of the cost for a round trip. The staff were very polite, friendly and smiley. I told them I was a nervous flier and 30 minutes or so after the take off one of the staff came and offered me to change seats to a less crowded part of the plane.  The flight was very pleasant, calm and faster than expected. The entertainment was as good as the airlines I had flown for so many years. I didn't like the coffee but I never drink any coffee that is not a good Brazilian quality, produced and packed in Brazil. The food was not to my taste.  The flight back from Rio was as good, and we arrived 22 minutes ahead schedule. I was very pleased with Norwegian and I will fly with them whenever I need to if they keep providing their services from Gatwick. Thank you.

The airline was prompt, clean, all the staff were courteous from check in to leaving the plane. I would totally recommend flying with them.

15269,Norwegian,9.0,"""a great product for the price""",2020-01-18,True,"  Have flown Norwegian over 30 times in the last year both short haul and long haul. This trip was a long haul from San Fran to Stockholm via London. I am a big fan of the airline. Almost always on time. Very friendly crew, especially in the long haul operation. Free wifi for all passengers regardless of ticket type (both short and long haul) and operates gate to gate (so no annoying need to log in and out on take off and landing). The premium offering long haul is, I would say, better than most airlines' premium economy but not as good as business class. Yet the price is exceptionally low for what you get. Essentially you pay about a normal airline's economy fare or less for an experience better than premium economy. The food in premium is high quality as are the drinks and the seats are good enough to get a reasonable sleep (although this is not a lie flat bed per business class). The IFE is modern and high quality albeit with a slightly smaller range of movies than a normal airline. Whilst Norwegian are no Ryanair, it is worth remembering that this is a budget airline. You are getting a major discount on long haul with a normal airline but in return you need to follow their rules. If your hand baggage weighs more than 10kg (or 15kg in premium) they will make you pay to check it in. In economy, you don't get a meal unless you pre-order and pay. Short haul they are more flexible with the rules on baggage but long haul they always check. Overall, a great product for the price.",Boeing 787-9,Business,Premium Economy,San Francisco to Stockholm via London,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,yes,January,2020
15274,Norwegian,7.0,"""seat is really up there at the top""",2019-12-23,True,"  Gatwick to Miami. I was unable to check in using the app and was told in the app that airport check in was required at Gatwick this was surpringly swift. The Norwegian desks were straight ahead from emerging from the exit from the railway terminal at the South terminal. A quick stop at the kiosk to check in and collect my boarding card the machine without prompting also printed another boarding card that acts as your lounge access pass. Very efficient. There was no queue at the Premium bag drop so I was straight to the agent via the security officer asking the usual questions. Bag drop done in seconds and headed to security screening. Norwegian does not provide fast track security at Gatwick but this wasn't an issue as it was really quick and I was airside in about 3 minutes. Gatwick process and technology not making us remove laptops and liquids. The lounge offering for Norwegian Premium Flex customers at Gatwick is the third party MyLounge. Whilst smart and comfortable has a very basic F&B offering. But it was a relaxing way to start the day. I deliberately didn't board until nearer departure so again had no queue at the gate where there is priority boarding for Premium customers. Once on board and after easily finding stowage for my back pack I was offered a glass of water, apple juice or orange juice. A bit dull. A glass of even prosecco would have been well received! I had seat 1A by the window. This front row seat is by the bulkhead and whilst offers no extra legroom than the other Premium seats, the front row has a major advantage; no passenger in front reclining into your space. From my experience flying Premium on other carriers this seat is really up there at the top. The leather covered armchair is wide with about 46"" seat pitch with a lot of recline and an extendable calf supporting foot rest. Whilst a flat bed it is not, it is very comfortable. The IFE comes out on a stalk from one of the arm rests and was easy to use. This even allows you to order drinks or snacks at your seat in between meal services. But I was surprised how poor and dated the choice of movies was. I really struggled to find something I wanted to watch. The inflight service did not start until we had departed about an hour. This was a drinks service and in Premium beer, wine and non-alcoholic beverages are free of charge throughout the flight. But if you want a cocktail you have to pay. I chose red wine though both wine offerings were low end. There are no pretzels, nuts or other snacks offered unless you're prepared to pay for them, which is a bit poor. The main meal was delivered about 30 mins later together with more drinks. As I was in the first row there was 3 choices available. I would say the food quality and quantity was on par with the likes of a BA Premium Economy meal, but it looked cheap as it is served in this flimsy long cardboard box holder with the entree still in foil and metal and very cheap plastic cutlery. The crew were responsive if you requested more beverages throughout the flight, but not particularly warm or friendly. About 90 minutes out of Miami a second meal service was offered. This was a salad with meat and bread rolls offered. Perfectly adequate quality and quantity as not the main meal. Again a full beverage service was offered identical to with the main meal. De planing was delayed by 5-10 minutes due to issues with the jet bridge.

The crew have always been really friendly up in the air and the team on the ground are also very helpful. You see people complaining but this is normally because they haven't followed basic rules or fully understood what a ""Low cost carrier"" is. Norwegian is a great experience, comfortable with space. The WiFi is great and the Premium Packages are also at good value, I had an incident with it where my messages where taking about 30 seconds to send each time (not a big deal) and even though I didn't ask, they sent me a full refund about 2 days after my flight was taken. Apart from this, not only is it fast but the portal has Audio Books, Movies, TV shows and even allows you to Order duty free ahead of arrival at certain airports, as well as a ""Things to do"" and a ""Moving Map"". The crew actually care about the job and care for passengers. For example, a passenger got a coffee which was a little cold and instead of ignoring him, the Cabin Crew went and made him a fresh one instantly. This was really good service and was dealt with in an efficient way. The little extra touches also make a good difference and this will always be my airline of choice.

You also get a free sugar kick via a paper cup of coke, a cookie and a candy in a swift non-dentist-friendly service which is not much, yet already 3x more than what you get on an LCC. Engaged FAs with a certain flair also add to the appeal. The problem was that the flight was delayed for over an hour yet no one considered it a good idea to inform people already queing up at the gate. It was only 5 mins after the original departure time (still on the gate screen) that a ground handling lady showed up to inform passengers that the plane hadn't taken off yet from Athens, so she couldn't really say when we would fly. Why on earth would A3 just let people go airside at what is easily one of the busiest airports per square ft, just to try to find a spot to seat for hours with no info? And even if the airport staff at Rhodes is overwhelmed, why don't you use the app to inform passengers? As I type this, I see that the Sunday flight was also an hour and 15 mins late.

Lounge at Hyderabad is common to all airlines and a pretty uninspiring place but on this occasion a young man was extremely attentive, serving me all I could ask for at my seat. I was among the last to board and was pleased that despite the full economy cabin the business class storage had not been encroached. On the 737-900 seating was 2+2 in a 12 seater cabin that was half full. We pushed back 3 minutes early and between then and the point of take off I was offered a hot or cold towel, a choice of lemon or melon juice (alcohol is not served on the ground in India), an Arabic coffee and fresh dates. Once in the air a menu was quickly presented. Slightly disappointing unless you happen to be a passionate fan of Hyderabadi food which the majority of passengers were and only one starter and dessert (see menu card). From the three mains I opted for the fish but requested it after one hour of the three hour journey. The menu listed only soft drinks but after I clarified a bar was available, I requested a gin (brand not evident) and tonic (served with no lemon or lime and little ice). This came with a small half full bowl of nuts that seemed flavoured with salt and vinegar. Before dinner I enquired about the wine selection. Two uninspiring mini bottles of red and white that I have had on economy in the past in other routes were offered, so I asked about Champaign and took this option. When it was poured out of my sight a stewardess came to apologise it was not chilled and offered ice - an unlikely combination. I was assured a second bottle was being chilled and this later transpired to be so. Dinner comprised a simple salad without dressing and fish which was cooked perfectly but came with accompaniments that were not hugely to my taste, and an Indian desert which, as is usually so, too sweet for my liking.

When we arrived at the La Paz International Airport, we queued in line for 1.5 hours even though there was only about 20 people in front of us. Once we reached the front, we were informed that there would be a delay of 2 hours. Having flown Peruvian a few times, this was not unexpected. However, after waiting in the gate area for about 3 hours, a staff member came to inform us that the flight was cancelled and we were to proceed back to the check in counter to claim our luggage. Many passengers, me included, had connections in Lima and needed to reach Lima ASAP. However the earliest flight that they were able to schedule was the next day and many of us were forced to miss our connections as the incompetence of the airline meant that they were not even able to put us on Avianca or Latam flights. Communication was poor throughout this process and the staff even had the nerve to ask me to take a 12 hour bus ride and a flight the subsequent morning from Cusco - even though this did not gurantee any of us being able to make the onward connections from Lima. Overall a horribly disappointing experience and if you have any option other than Peruvian Airlines, I highly recommend that you choose to exercise that option.",Boeing 737,Family Leisure,Economy Class,La Paz to Lima via Cusco,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,December,2017

July 2 checked in day and the American Airlines (partner) assistant told me that she cannot check me in because of the tight schedule of my connecting flight and she cannot checked in my luggage. I have to call Philippine Airlines customer agent to have it fix and they did, but now instead of arriving early to Cebu it be at a later date. I have to wait 6 hours for my flight to Manila to Cebu. Now that was just the beginning of my nightmare. On my return flight which was scheduled 8:15 am (Cebu to Manila) was cancelled and changed to 10:35 am 2 days before my actual flight on July 17. I arrived 6:00Am in Mactan airport just to hear that my flight was cancelled and they are working to have me reroute. I waited for 2 hours to have it fix. Now, instead of 2 hours layover to Manila. I have to wait for 9 hours for my Manila-LA flight which is now scheduled to 9:05pm instead of the original schedule 11:25 am. While my flight was still in mid air in LA, my connecting flight to Las Vegas via American Airlines left me because Philippine Airlines ticketing agent did not give enough time for transfer. My Manila-LA flight was 9:05pm to 7:50 pm but the aircraft was delayed in Manila due to documentation process and we arrive later around 8: 20 pm, and boarding time for American Airlines was 8:10pm and I am still at LA customs and picking up luggage that by the time I have to check in to American Airlines, I was told that my flight already departed and I have been rebooked to another airline (DELTA), now I have to walk outside again and have to look for Terminal 3 to look for Delta Airlines.

I will not recommend anyone to fly with PAL until they get their operations and training right. Our transit experience at MNL to MEL was utterly unpleasant. PAL's ground staff failed to communicate what is required of transit passengers in advance and made us go around in circles, doing unnecessary processes and had a horrible surprise at the boarding gate when we were told that we need to go to another location to have our check-in bags opened up for inspection just before our flight. It is also unacceptable that some crew on PR508 flying from SIN to MNL on 8 June was sleeping on the Premium Economy seats, even thought the cabin was empty. PAL, once again changed our flight timing from MEL to MNL on 18 June and changed the A330 from the refurbished cabin to their older product with a terrible 2-2-2 configuration with no IFE on board and seats with different height. What doesn't make sense is that they allocate me and my partner to sit separately, across the aisle despite having the same booking.

The cabin crew was professional, courteous, and attentive, even passing out menus in economy which I haven't seen in years. Hot towels were passed out before landing, again a nice touch. After a smooth and wonderful flight, what spoiled everything was that not all of our luggage was delivered. The baggage personnel stated that my son's baggage 2 pieces, and my wife's baggage 1 piece was pulled and not loaded on our aircraft due to possible weight issues which I don't believe, as none of this was ever brought to my attention when we checked in our luggage. My wife and son completed the paperwork for the missing luggage and for compensation. The baggage personnel stated they would load the baggage on the next day's PR 101 and deliver to our hotel. The flight is delayed even more, not landing in Manila until approximately 9pm tonight. I hope our missing luggage will be delivered, my son had to buy clothes since none of his luggage was delivered. As much as I would like to give PAL a 5star rating because of the wonderful inflight service, this luggage issue prevents me from doing this.

It feels like they never considered improving their Middle East flights since most passengers are Filipino Expatriates but of course, their flights going to countries such asUS, Canada, UK, Australia are way better - better leg space and actual screens for in-flight entertainment.

There was no stowage for blanket/pillow apart from your lap or the floor in front of you. One was viewing the monitor from a distance of about 4-5 feet. Generally, it was not comfortable, or what i would expect in 2023. The food would have been Ok for Premium Economy. The wine was generic and Ok for no better than Economy.

16002,Philippine Airlines,5.0,"""don't care much about frequent flyers""",2023-01-16,True,"  The focus of my review at this time is on their Mabuhay Miles frequent flyer program. I usually take a domestic flight which will connect to Manila or Cebu for an international flight, all via PAL. This saves me from trouble in case I would miss my connection. From experience, they would rebook me to the next flight for free, if there are problems with the connection. And that is okay. But accommodation and food aren't included, though that's fine by me. With so many flights, I became a frequent flyer and their program is useful in terms of extra baggage allowance and priority tag, priority boarding, and lounge access. But that's it, they don't care much about frequent flyers in other aspects, especially redemption. If you redeem a one-way international flight ticket, expect that your hard earned miles are to be practically useless, because you will still pay a huge amount. Even if you redeem a round trip ticket, you will still pay hefty airline charges because apparently, the miles are only for the base fare. I've been so used to flying with SQ where I only pay the very minimal $10 airport tax upon miles redemption, even for a oneway MNL-SIN ticket. So I find PAL's redemption rules weird and a money grab. Then there's the problem with redemption nominees that can be easily done online  with other airlines like SQ, but not PAL. It's like 1995, you need visit their ticket office or call their hotlines if you want to redeem for other people. They would have you wait for 2 to 3 hours at their ticket office (worst experience in their ticket office in Alabang), then charge you a rush fee for redemption made less than 10 days from the intended flight. From the provinces in P.I., I now take an extra day for layover in Manila just to fly with other airlines because PAL is getting ridiculous.

16004,Philippine Airlines,1.0,"""seat was just uncomfortable""",2023-01-15,True,"  Philippine Airlines have the sheer arrogance of placing a Business Class passenger into a broken seat that will never turn into anything comfortable to sleep on. Worst still, I thought the seat was just uncomfortable and that was the way it was supposed to be. After 2 hours of struggling to get comfortable, I gave up sliding down the seat and it was only then I noticed the issue. Earlier in the flight, I was having a chat with one of the stewardesses and she said something about broken seats. I thought I mis-heard her and dismissed it. After letting a steward know, he got a box for the seat to prop up on. Far too late by then. Damage was done, the other passengers' children had had their sleep and there was no letting up on their noise from there on out. I'm glad I had Neurofen on hand for the headache. Why wasn't I told from the start about this? Was it the case that I wasn't going to notice or not care? Better not to alert the other passengers of the failure either else they might have something to say in social media? Towards the end of the flight, another seat failed and then my partner lets me know she can't place any weight on her chair without it collapsing. Word of advice to Philippine Airline ""Business Class"" passengers. Don't assume by paying $1000s extra that your trip is going to be anywhere near ""Business Class"".

16032,Philippine Airlines,2.0,"""refunding the same ticket is 150 dollars""",2022-10-07,True,"  The flight from LA to the final destination Dumaguete via Manila was actually relatively pain free. Seats are uncomfortable after a few hours especially when you are 6 foot plus like myself. Food was borderline comparable to just about any experience you've had in your life when you wish you didn't eat something but I believe just about all airlines serve bad meals.  My first major complaint with Philippine Airlines is the cost to check bags. The two bags I checked from LA to Manila were free. Checking the same two bags plus the two my wife had resulted in a 200 dollar fee for the relatively short flight from MNL to Dumaguete. That domestic flight wasn't even half full so not sure other than the obvious greediness explanation why Philippine Airlines charges this much to check bags. My other main complaint is I had also booked a one way ticket to Bangkok from Manila. As the date for that flight was getting close to arriving, my wife's mother became seriously ill and was hospitalized. This event made it impossible to make that flight to Bangkok. So I contacted Philippines Airline to request a refund since I don't know when my wife's mother will recover and we could visit Thailand as originally planned. A one way ticket from Manila was 130 dollars but Philippines Airline adds 50 dollars in fees just to book the ticket. The amount they charge for refunding the same ticket is 150 dollars. Not to mention the hoops you have to jump through with their request hub submission process and the ridiculous 25 to 30 minutes you have to spend on hold when they make you contact them by phone to explain the same exact details provided inside the written request. I'm not sure how these airlines are able to stay in business but one thing is very apparent, customer satisfaction isn't any type of priority or concern. It's a sad situation because the airlines in general and Philippines airline in particular seem to have way more interest in figuring out ways to gouge their customers every way possible than to follow practices that might make them happy.",Boeing 777,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Manila,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,September,2022

16208,Pobeda Airlines,1.0,"""bring people to the bus far too early""",2018-09-20,True,"  Travelling by Pobeda from Moscow Vnukovo to Krasnodar on Sep 15th. Vnukovo Airport is easy and comfortable. This is also the main hub of Pobeda. Pobeda, being a lowcoster, does not use jetways and they bring the passengers to the plane by bus. No problem with if it is managed professionally. I was boarding the bus at 16:05 (not the first one) and leaving the bus to board the plane at about 16:45. So rather than efficiently managing the boarding, they simply bring people to the bus far too early and let the passengers to wait there for next 40 min. (or more). As you know, there is a very limited number of seats in airport buses. In an overcrowded bus there were elderly people and mothers with a small kids standing all that time and waiting.

Qantas check in, at Canberra (CBR) could not even see dedicated business check in and used the general boarding machines. Qantas lounge is comfortable but no dedicated business lounge in CBR just one shared with Qantas Club. At time of boarding, they just called the flight so no priority for business or premium FF members. On the plane we were only offered water prior to the flight. The plane was comfortable, and the seating was good. The meal was good overall, but we were not offered any re-fills or a second beverage. Basically, the attendant seemed to be looking at herself in her phone screen over providing service. Following service my empty water bottle and napkin clearly was visible in the front seat pocked but was never cleaned up, even though there was plenty of time on completion of the lunch service.

Gate staff continuously blamed other factors such as cleaning staff taking longer than required or no gate available as reasons for the delay. When questioned on boarding as to why the plane couldn’t be cleaned in the preceding 5 hours, I was simply told to email customer care, which seems to be the go to response for most Qantas ground staff these days when confronted with polite complaints about the ever increasing delays at Qantas. Cabin crew were pleasant and helpful and the economy class supervisor was amazing, as she singled my family out for special attention and care. This had more to do with my frequent flyer status rather than just being a passenger receiving great service. Aircraft was 19 years old and showing its age. Broken fittings on the seats and in the toilets, ripped seat covers and damaged wall panels, the plane had clearly seen better days. Seats are narrow and leg room and recline are minimal compared to the likes of other major airlines. Food was inedible, bland and prison canteen style. Qantas have dispensed with trays containing an assortment of items and metal cutlery is no longer. You now just get a small portioned bowl with foil on top and a piece of bread slapped on the foil and some wooden cutlery in an envelope. Silver lining is that it’s easy to slip the bowl on the floor under your seat when you decide not to eat anything. Qantas is doing just enough so as not to be seen as a budget carrier while charging a premium price.

The delay was due to a problem with a seat barrier in business class, but there were already 2 chairs not working in premium economy. We made up the time in the air but it was still frustrating to get to the airport on time only for a delay like this - surely the seats are regularly serviced? The flight crew were pleasant. The meals were average. No strong flavours, good if you like bland food. The worst part was the cleanliness of the seat (see photo of vestibule next to seat). You don’t want to sit down for a 16 hour flight, and find that the seat hasn’t been cleaned from the last flight. I think the cleaning crew might not be plugging in their vacuum cleaners when cleaning.

We paid extra for these seats and for what? and also there in front of us was the staff cabin box which was constantly been locked and unlocked too frequently throughout the flight so we hardly slept.

While posting billions in post pandemic profits I wanted to share what my recent experience of a Qantas flight looks like from a customer perspective. But firstly on a positive note thank you Qantas my luggage and I arrived on time and safely in Brisbane always a plus but that’s where any positive news ends. The seats are amongst the narrowest I’ve seen and unfortunately the seat in front of me appears to have been broken resulting in the passenger in front spending the entirety of the trip virtually sleeping in my lap to the extent that I had to tilt the screen to continue watching the inflight entertainment which is outdated and limited in choice compared to carriers such as Emirates and Qatar. The food service was a laughing stock, who serves a paddle pop and a Lindor ball and considers that as appropriate anywhere but a 5 year olds birthday party this was on the flight to Singapore. After the food service there was no drink service as the crew ensconced themselves at the rear of the plane with the curtain drawn making it feel intrusive to seek out a water after a limbo dance to extract yourself from the passenger in fronts reclined seat. An hour before landing passengers were served a pastry that resembled something you would find 3 days down the track in the pie Beaumaris at 7/11. This was the final leg on my trip from Europe so my welcome back home flight which was purchased on codeshare on an Airfrance booking after I was unable to use a 1k Qantas flight credit from a cancelled US flight from 2020. The quote from QANTAS for a return flight to Paris economy using the flight credit was 8k solo and I have now waited 3 years for my flight refund it seems ironic that I ended up on this codeshare flight when I was not able to book an equivalent flight with Qantas direct Avoid this airline at all costs",A330,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Brisbane,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,no,May,2023

A no would have been fine but the female crew member at the rear of the flight rudely said no and then as my wife turned to come back to our seats she heard the crew mumble under her breath ""as if we'd give it to you anyway"".

This is so unfortunate and I find it an embarrassment for how foreign visitors are treated. Qantas has for many years been too casual and aloof in their customer interactions. They can learn a lot from the Asian carriers. Additionally Qantas smashed our checked luggage so the case is no longer usable.

16427,Qantas Airways,1.0,"""never been treated with such disrespect""",2022-12-29,False," I want to talk about service in business class aboard Flight QF 24 that left Bangkok to Sydney, Australia on Dec 26th 2022. My boyfriend and I travel very often, and ALWAYS get business class seats for not just the comfortable seating but most importantly the service and respect. This has been present in every flight we have ever taken, besides this one. We boarded the plane and everything was lovely; seats were nicely prepared and comfortable. We sat and got settled in when one of the staff came around with the normal complimentary champagne which was greatly appreciated. We even asked for a second glass before take off, and were given it no problem at all. Once the flight took off, we were waiting for the normal first class flight attendants to come around and refresh our beverages. We got nothing, only eyes gearing the other way from our seats while we were trying to get the attention from one of the three attendants servicing our area. So, we decided to wait patiently for an hour and a half from take-off when they came around asking what we would like for dinner. My boyfriend and I both asked our separate flight attendants for a refresher, which we were then told we had to wait till after dinner was served (Never have we ever been told no, or ""wait"" in first class) again, one of the reasons we chose to spend thousands on these special seats. Finally we got our second drink after 2 hours had passed at this point. I asked for a glass or champagne and wine, and was told by a male flight attendant, ""you can only have one"" while my boyfriend sat with two glasses next to me, and also before take-off we were given two glasses of champagne? That made no sense and felt extremely weird energy from the staff after this. He then came back and asked if I'd like that second drink now, and I responded “yes please” remaining respectful and grateful. As he comes back for the third time about 20-30 minutes after the second glass was poured, he offers me another drink, but throws in “would you like to start with a glass of water first?” I felt very uncomfortable that he offered me water, without me asking for it, and awkwardly accepted the water. I have never in my 8 years of flying business/first class been asked a question like he did, especially when I was completely reserved and respectful, not one bit out of character. And after he had said/acted this way towards me, the flight attendant that was servicing my boyfriend was approaching him to ask him if he'd like another drink as well. The staff quickly walked to the other side and whispered something in that employee's ear while he was in the middle of pouring my boyfriend a drink, and again, that flight attendant asked him “would you like a glass of water to start with?”. My boyfriend firmly said “No, I would not” as he was officially picking up on the disrespect and completely uncalled for attitude towards both of us. We both became extremely irritated and felt very welcomed and disrespected. We have flown on countless airlines, business/first class seats, and like I said earlier, have NEVER been treated with such disrespect and immatureness from first class flight attendants. We are both successful people and enjoy being treated with respect wherever we go, which is why, like I said, we spend our hard earned money to get that same treatment.",A330,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Bangkok to Sydney,4.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,no,December,2022

16537,Qatar Airways,2.0,"""never experienced such a disengaged crew""",2023-07-27,True," I don't know what has happened to Qatar in recent times. I've always chosen them for my frequent long-haul business class travel but my last experiences have been very disappointing. Qatar used to have the ability to make their customers feel like individuals but they've lost that skill. On this trip, my outbound flight from Manchester was delayed by a passenger becoming ill. Whilst I sympathise with a passenger, falling ill, of course, a speedier decision would've saved me and many other passengers from missing connections, which we inevitably did. We sat on the plane strapped in for an hour and 45 minutes, whilst it seemed the captain dithered over whether or not to offload the passenger. He did not offload them. Upon arrival in Doha, 15 minutes after my connection had already departed, I was unceremoniously handed a new ticket for a flight which left at 02:25, 7.5 hours later with not a whiff of an apology for the massive inconvenience caused. There was a flight leaving for Jakarta at 8 pm via Singapore, but I was not offered that option. There was another flight leaving at 08:25 the next morning which would have suited me best, but I was not offered that choice either. I asked if I could go into a hotel for the night to rest properly before taking the 08:25 flight in the morning. They advised me that because my delay was 'less than eight hours' (it was 7.5 hours.) I was not entitled to a hotel. The business lounge in Qatar is not designed for lengthy waits so I asked if I might enter the first-class lounge at least for the duration of my wait given that the delay was the fault of the airline. I was refused because I am 'not a member' When eventually we finally left Doha on that 02:25 flight, I was already exhausted. To my dismay, my seat was next to the galley where I heard the crew banging, talking and generally being noisily disrespectful to all passengers in the proximity for the duration of the flight. In fact, in all my flights with Qatar, I have never experienced such a disengaged crew as this one. As a result, I got no sleep on this 9 hour flight. To add to the disappointment, as with my flight from Jakarta to Manchester three weeks earlier, media on the video system does not correspond with the series being advertised i.e., the new series of White Lotus that I was looking forward to watching, whilst being labelled as the latest one set in Sicily, in fact, was the original series which is now a few years old. To have that mistake on one flight is marginally acceptable, but to have incorrect media on all flights is just sloppy. I'm led to conclude that I need to look for a different airline to rely on now as Qatar's previously exemplary standards have dropped to those offered by the other very average business-class airline providers.",Boeing 777,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Manchester to Jakarta via Doha,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,no,July,2023
16538,Qatar Airways,3.0,"""downgraded to the old seating""",2023-07-26,True," -I was informed three month ago that all 3 sectors of my itinerary were downgraded to the old seating. I was able to change my flights back to Qsuites by changing flights, but had to accept a 12h layover at Doha airport. Since I can sleep on overnight flights in the Qsuite only, I accepted the offer. Unfortunately both flights were downgraded again, I was informed about the Bangkok to Doha sector 3 days ago, and about the Doha to Zurich sector just 6h before the departure of the flight.  I was up to now willing to pay more, since Qsuites are in high demand and rates were this time around €350 higher than other configuration. When I requested compensation for the previous flights, since I paid a premium for those Qsuite bookings too, I received 2 identical pre-written standard responses saying that they were not willing to compensate, not even with some Qmiles. I am really upset, since the Qsuites are promoted everywhere on the booking app, but what’s the point of booking a Qsuite if I don get it! One of the mentioned flights was my 100th on Qatar, about 70% in Business class, but it never happened that there was a aircraft change from an old configuration to Qsuite, only the other way round. On a lighter note, the flights were outstanding, esp. the Bangkok to Doha sector (QR839) with great food and service. I want to thank especially the wonderful and hard working Purser and her team. I can’t really recommend Qatar at this point, since the hardware problems are getting from bad to worse.

16542,Qatar Airways,1.0,"""best service provided""",2023-07-20,True," It's good to note that Qatar Airways open its check in counter 5 1/2 hours before departure! Good thing I went to NAIA cause I thought its going to rain and it might cause traffic! Started forming our lines at 5:30pm and counters open exactly 5:50pm fir the 11:20pm flight. Check in process was quiet slow, despite my Silver Status I left the counter at 6:40pm. Understandably only two counters were open since the other check in staff are assisting the 6:35pm departure. Anyway, though it was slow but OK since the clerk was super nice and offered me a complimentary lounge pass! The plane departed around 15 minutes later than published but was able to overcome and arrived earlier in Doha! Was a very smooth landing and the crew were all warm! Food served dinner and breakfast were both sumptuous and delicious! I was seated on a window seat and was quiet cramped because the guy beside me was humungous. Arrival in Doha was as expected very warm and pleasant, security check was fast and quick! A separate lounge for Silver members were provided, and was surprised of its huge size, very comfortable, good food, very clean comfort rooms! Went to the gate early as it was quiet far but thanks to the sky train, I was at my gate in seconds! Fortunately, I was upgraded to Business Class on the second leg of the journey! It was a very pleasant experience considering the 13 hours flight to Montreal! Everything went perfectly well! The very comfortable Q Suite, the award winning Catering and the Best Crew Services contributed to an overall pleasant experience!

First time flying Q-Suite of Qatar Airline, have heard many good things about it prior to departure which turned out to be exactly as advertised. You get your own spacious suite, comfortable seat, plenty of storage, great food, all are better than other business class experiences that I had. What really went well beyond my expectation was the cabin crew. From the time I boarded they have always been super attentive with prompt service of what I needed. Special Kudo to Amit the supervisor, Hattaya who handled my section with a smile that can light up the cabin, plus Chenny and Asil who both were in the front (Apologies to the rest of the wonderful crew whose names I didn't quite remember) Moreover, the lounge in Doha is just fantastic. There have been plenty of praise about the facilities so I am not going to repeat here. However I really want to point out that all the staffs are well-trained and always proactively helping out asking for our needs, which is not something I experienced in most of the business class lounge. They were also very serious about the work product they delivered. We ordered a steak at the dining room that turned out to be too well-done and not tender, we made a very slight comment about it and five minutes later the Chef came out and explained to us that they deliberately didn't leave it too rare and we are all travelers so they want to be on the safe side. The only drawback is the inflight WIFI. $10 for a full flight plan is very reasonable so I purchased it right on board. However after I napped the system could no longer recognize me so I had to make another purchase.

Because of this, I had to run for my connecting flight. The old 788 on the 2nd leg of the journey was in a rather poor sate and not clean.

I would say that onboard services and staff are as good as it gets and ground service and staff are the complete opposite. Baggage was destroyed on my outbound flight and customer service has been useless in dealing with the issue and made no effort to resolve the issue before my inbound flight. The baggage allowance for business class is 40 kilos. The fee for extra baggage ranges from 10£/kilo up to 18£/kilos depending on the time you purchase it. They forgot one of my special diet meals on of my flights, providing me with  the breakfast on an overnight flight where 2 meals were offered (late dinner and breakfast). What made things worse was the Stewardess trying to convince me that because I ordered the special meal I only get breakfast! Then the supervisor came over to admit the mistake and apologise.

Ground staff, lounge staff and on board crew always took extra the step to make my journey better. All flights departed and arrived on time. Food and Beverage options were excellent on board as well in the lounges. My only negative comment might be on boarding practices in Manila. There is a boarding card and passport check prior to entering boarding gate which is same as everywhere else. After this scanning the boarding card before boarding the aircraft which is also same but there is one more person only who checks the boarding card on the link bridge and finally the on board crew.

The plane was equipped with QR’s QSuite which was a great experience. Service was very friendly, efficient and attentive. There was a lovely glas of champagne or of something else as a welcome drink. The purser welcomed every customer in the QSuite section with their name and a quick informal chat which I found very pleasant because this practice seems to have been abandoned by a lot of other airlines. Then, the stewardess took our food and drinks orders and asked us when we would like to eat. She also explained the features of the QSuite seat. Food was tasty and of high quality. Everybody received an amenity kit (Dyptique) and pajamas. As this was an overnight flight, we soon settled in and I had a very good sleep in comfortable bedding.

Toilets are quite limited, I had to wait in line for 10 min for a toilet booth. Boarding was organized chaos in all 4 flights, especially the last one from Doha to Athens, where we had to had to use buses. Wait in line for a bus to arrive and delayed departure because of that. Check in was OK in Athens, very slow in Bangkok, had to wait 40 min in line. Food and service was fine in all flights but nothing spectacular, for example no sparkling water.

So my husband and I 'short-checked' our carry-on bags to our next airline, since the next airline we transferred to would have enough room to stow them overhead. Then, we took this tiny 19-seater plane, which (once boarding was finished) started up the engines only to have them shut off three times, before the stewardess announced ""something is wrong, the pilots are going to try fix it"" (that's comforting) and gave out cookies to passengers to shift focus. Finally we were told by the pilots that there was a technical issue that could be 'deferred for now', and once they get paperwork done then we can take off. At one point early on, we were told it would be about 15 more minutes, then about half an hour later they said it'll be about 10 more minutes until takeoff. Overall we were delayed IN the plane sitting there pre-runway for an hour. And our next layover was 1 hr 20 min, so when we arrived at the next airport, we had literally 10 minutes until the next plane terminal would close the gate, to deplane, get our bags from baggage claim, go through security, and run to our next gate. Upon deplaning, we asked the ground crew if we could just grab our short-checked bags right there on the Tarmac, they said no. We were told the baggage claim was close by - which it wasn't. My husband and I ran (not a good idea when you're 7 months pregnant and not a runner by nature), he ran to baggage claim to get our bags while I ran to our next gate to try keep the door open until my husband arrived with our bags. As soon as I arrived, I was told to get onboard right now, and when I begged them to wait just a couple minutes for my husband who was running up as we spoke, they said they could not and closed the door right in front of me. Thanks a lot Ravn, for making us short-check our appropriately sized carry-on's,  having technically unsound planes, being untruthful about how much more time we'd be delayed on the Tarmac,  not letting us grab our short-checked bags after de-planing, and not apparently notifying the next gate that multiple passengers (including us) were delayed and on their way running to he gate. It ruined our night and our trip home, and we felt so ripped off by this airline.

They agreed to change my ticket to a same-day connection on Turkish Airlines, which was 100 times better. The only thing I liked about RAM was the food, which was actually very tasty (delicious chicken or fish).

Avoid this Airline at all costs for long haul flights. If you buy a ticket with this airline you only have yourself to blame when things go wrong. For the second time in 2 weeks Royal Brunei have cancelled their Brunei to London flight resulting in delays of more than 12 hours and hundreds of stranded passengers. They knew full well when we left Manilla that there was no serviceable aircraft waiting in Brunei and one was having to be flown in from Jeddah. Despite knowing they had 100 plus passengers arriving their response was nothing short of appalling. Staff giving contradictory info as to what next. Passengers left outside the terminal in the early hours of the morning to wait up to two further hours for 16 seat buses to get checked into a dirty smelling hotel with no food and water provided. Passengers in wheelchairs just dumped outside. The replacement flight was due to leave 11.45 next day this also delayed due to ""technical difficulties"" on a different 787. Ground staff could not care less, we had to argue for nearly 60 minutes just to get access to WIFI so we could update friends and family of our late arrival. To top it off despite having our bags in the airport overnight they did not join us when we eventually arrived in London. 28 hours to get from Brunei to London. I've been flying over 20 years and we've all had delays it's part and parcel of long haul travel. The difference here is how Royal Brunei conducted themselves both during and after. They should be absolutely ashamed of the way they treat their customers. Royal Brunei point blank refuse to compensate passangers.

We were staying overnight in BSB and were not told that we had to pay $5 each for a visa but at least we got a nice stamp in our passport. Flight from BSB was on an A320 and again very comfortable and great service. On return from Hong Kong to BSB the lounge at HK was excellent as was the business lounge at BSB. Crew on this flight also very good. Then again only 4 of us in business class. Boarding the 787 to Melbourne was a bit clumsy at the gate. Told by a passenger next to me who had been on the flight from London that my seat was broken and would not go flat. Found this to be true but in the end 3 crew members jumped all over it and got it sorted. The meals were good. Didn’t miss the grog.

IFE is OK - take your own headphones. Crew are very good. The price is very low compared to other airlines. However, this is a small airline with no back up plan if things go wrong - and they do. We had a 13 hour delay in Brunei but met people who were delayed several days. RB put us into a basic 3 star hotel for the night and organised a pretty poor evening meal but a meal nontheless. We also travelled with people who had experienced this sort of delay several times.

They are spacious and have excellent legroom, I'm 6'7 and was able to stretch out my legs under the seat in front of me with ease. The best legroom out of any of the major international airlines flying to Europe. Food was great. Good hearty meals and a decent portion size. Hot meals served on all 3 flights. Lots of snacks and drinks offered during the flight. It is a dry airline but being a part cultural thing, not having that glass of wine with my meal wasn't a huge deal, you can bring your own alcohol on board but no-one seemed to take advantage of this. In flight entertainment is good, not the best variety when compared to other majors but a good selection of movies and TV shows to get you through the flight there and back. I didn't notice a huge change in the movies from July to August apart from a couple new additions but this certainly wasn't a big issue. If you want more movies, bring your own laptop. Two stop overs on the journey to London, a 3 hour stop in Brunei which is not too bad.

You pay for a flatbed, and they give you a cramped upright seat on a dirty old A320. It is a scam because you have no recourse and no way to change flights or ask for a refund due to the late notice of aircraft change being provided. We had a long flight from Rome to Bangkok and we booked RJ, especially and only because they advertised a flatbed on a new 787. Less than 24 hours before departure we got an email, you have an aircraft change to a short haul A320, with cramped uprights seats. I phoned their reservation centre who are hopeless and couldn't understand what the problem was. Ground staff and the cabin crew had no interest in the problem and besides what could they do. Look at flight data they do this regularly, sell with the promise of a flat bed on a new aircraft and then swap out an old A320 the day prior with pax having no recourse and due to the last-minute change, no ability to seek other flight options. Do not trust them. Do not waste your money. Oh, and by the way in their own business lounge, you have to pay $25 for a shower. And the food was inedible.

About 2 hour wait at the airport followed by another 3-4 hour wait at the Amman Airport Hotel (a 2 star facility at best) in the middle of the night to get a room key for room arranged by airline. Complete chaos at the hotel with no airline representative present and the airline had also ‘forgotten’ to provide vouchers before shipping passengers from 3 different cancelled flights to the hotel. Airline also stamped a very restrictive transit visa on everyone’s passport which forbade leaving the hotel or getting a different hotel on own expense. I qualified for a tourist visa on arrival but was not informed. I would have gladly paid for my own accommodation in a different hotel but was informed that I couldn’t leave - I was literally in a jail! Room was a shambles with no towels, dirty floors, broken furniture. Other flights cancelled too with families with children in poor state with not even water offered to them. One of my worst airline experiences in 40 years of air travel and my first and last time on this airline. I’m an Emerald (highest tier) member on One World and booked on RJ as they’re a One World airline. Does One World have any basic standards of membership ? Seems not.

On their website it's written that transit passengers do not require it, as well Egypt as final destination doesn't require it.

17117,Royal Jordanian Airlines,1.0,"""sad about the bad experience""",2021-11-18,False,"  I was traveling from Amman to Los Angeles. This was not a direct flight and it was stopped in London. I was in the waiting lines for close to 2 hours. Luckily I was ahead of time. When I approached the counter, I was asked for my passport and my ticket. I was told that I need to get a Visa from London for Covid. I was trying to explain to the counter staff that I was just going to be in London just for the few hours in the airport and go on another flight from there to Los Angeles as a transit. He was confused and yelling at other workers, asking if I needed a visa for this transit. The process was unprofessional and un-respectable. I had only 25 minutes to get to the flight. I asked if there was any way he could help me out and told me to visit, Passenger locator form and register myself. The internet was very slow and I was being accused for having a poor travel agent since I had not filled out this form. I called the travel agency and they looked at the book and the manual and called Royal Jordanian and informed them that I didn't need to fill out the form for Covid. They said it was only for those planning on staying in London, not for a transit flight. This cost me $100 since I had to redo the form twice. At the end they told me I was right. One of the workers escorted me to the flight. I am surprised why all the workers have no idea what the difference between a transit passenger and a passenger visiting. I was under stress for two and a half hours, and finally when I approached the boarding area to the plane. They asked me about the visa AGAIN! There was not supposed to be an application for a transit passenger. When I sit down in the airplane, I asked for water. They told me they will get me a cup of water before the plane took off. I didn't see the flight attendant again for another 45 minutes. The staff scream to each other. There is no manager or any one who knows what they are doing. Even in London, I checked with American Airlines, and it took me five minutes with a boarding pass. They understood I was just a transit passenger. There is a big difference about the service between AA and RJ. I am very sad about the bad experience. Hopefully they fix things in the future.

17134,Royal Jordanian Airlines,6.0,"""attendants are practically invisible""",2020-01-08,True,"  The Boeing 787 is relatively new and the economy seats have great legroom. The food quality is decent and the time between meals is not too long. But don't board the flight super hungry as the food might not be enough.  Inflight entertainment is decent and provides enough options to kill time on a long flight.  Amman airport is modern and has so decent food options. Also the Petra lounge is very nice and doesn't get very crowded. If you have a tight connection they may hold the flight for you. Luggage made the connection. Amman airport is very poorly organized. There is a serious lack of professionalism. Upon arrival there is an initial security screening for connecting passengers. It looks as though this security station was shoved into a hallway without the architect's knowledge. The line is chaotic and nobody has thought to add ropes. They also don't communicate what is going on so most passengers are unsure of where to go or what to do. Also, passengers travelling to the US & Canada have to have their passports and visas checked before passing security. But when I was there one of the two agents working this counter abruptly left. Leaving about 100 passengers with tight connections in a panic. Nobody communicated anything about what was going on. For US & Canada flights there is yet another security station. And here too nobody has thought about adding ropes to organize the line up. Note this is the third line you have to wait in when connecting. Despite having not appropriately resourced the airport to handle large volumes, for some reason they schedule multiple US & Canada flights within 30 mins of each other. So the 800 or so passengers totally overwhelm the airport facilities during high season. The flight attendants are practically invisible when a meal is not being served. They just lounge in the galley at the back. You need to use the call button to get any service but they seem to resent you for disturbing them when you do so. There are long periods of time (up to 4 hours) between meals where no drinks are served. On most other long haul airlines the cabin crew will walk the aisles to pass around cups of water every few hours. It took almost two hours to remove the meal trays from the seats.

17541,SATA Air Azores,2.0,"""always some problem""",2018-09-30,True," Lisbon to Ponta Delgada. I don't know where to begin. I fly Azores Airlines (SATA) quite regularly and there is always some problem with this airline. If it's not delays or aircraft breaking down, its losing your baggage or bad customer service. The food is really bad and after all the complaints, I don't understand why they have not changed it yet. Recently I flew on a leased A340 aircraft operated by a Spanish airline called Plus Ultra Airlines for SATA. The flight was from Lisbon to Ponta Delgada and then the aircraft was continuing on to Toronto. Thankfully, my final destination was Ponta Delgada, and I didn't need to continue on the what would have been a long and horrible journey to Toronto. The flight was delayed which is no surprise since I have never seen a flight of SATA depart on schedule. Whilst onboard we were given no briefing by the flight crew why the flight was delayed. We stayed at our stand for almost an hour. As a frequent flyer this aircraft was the worst aircraft I have ever been on. It was very dirty, and didn't look like it had been cleaned for a long time. Parts of the interior were very deteriorated and almost falling apart. The inflight entertainment remotes were falling out of their place exposing the wires or had parts broken off it. The tables needed force to take out and put them back in. The bathroom was very dirty. The crew were not helpful at all.

17544,SATA Air Azores,1.0,"""airline gets worse every year""",2018-08-15,True,"  Boston to Terceira. This airline gets worse every year. They essentially have the monopoly in the Azores, as far as routes and usually pricing, meaning they don't care how poorly they treat customers. I have often had them tell me there are no flights available, only to arrive at the airport to see the exact flight I wanted only half full. I have flown close to 100 times, and almost a dozen times with SATA, and I have never been asked to weigh my carry-on bags. Any other airline doesn't generally care, as long as it fits. On 12 August, we were on a flight that was less than half full, on a large A321 with plenty of overhead and cabin space. I assume because they wanted to make some extra bang for their buck, they stopped every single person at the boarding pass counter and made them weigh every carry on. If you wanted to keep it, you had to pay $100 to check it, whether it had medications or anything. The average weight of just a carry on bag alone is 9 lbs, meaning virtually no carry on will ever be light enough to be under 17 lbs. SATA has a tendency to underbook flights and delay or cancel a lot, but why they decide to gouge everyone again at the counter is beyond me. This aircraft was also utterly filthy, as when we opened our tray tables they were covered in an unknown sticky substance. I would love to tell you to never book with SATA, but sometimes you don't have a choice. If you can, do as much research as possible, as TAP, Delta, and RyanAir are starting to get flights to the islands. Maybe if they start losing enough business, they will start treating people better!",A321,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Terceira,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,no,August,2018
17548,SATA Air Azores,1.0,"""ashamed of this Portuguese airline""",2018-04-05,True,"  Last month we traveled with them and it was a nightmare. First the agency (eDREAMS) that booked our flights made a ""mistake"" on the name of my daughter (infant). Because she has a long name, they only put down her initials for the first name. The last name and date of birth were correct. Noticing the mistake my wife contacted them and told them about the situation, and they said that we needed to contact eDREAMS to get it solved. My wife literally spent more than 5 hours between eDREAMS and SATA to get this solved. SATA insisted that there was nothing they could do, which sounded like a lie because if we decided to pay they could get it done. After many other calls, eDREAMS paid for the change (which was fine by me). On the day of the flight they printed the boarding passes and there it was my daughter's name was incomplete,  and what did they do? Fill the missing characters by hand! They made us go through all that trouble for nothing! On the flights to Portugal we had no issues, but on the way back to the US it was a very long trip. First flight from Lisbon to Ponta Delgada was fine and they served a small snack. The second flight from Ponta Delgada to Boston was late about 2hr and during the flight they announced that they wouldn't be serving food. Why? According to the ""chief of cabin"" they did not have enough crew and therefore everybody had to starve for 5hr 45 minutes. No compensation or warning was given to passengers about this situation so that they can find alternatives other than starving. This is unacceptable specially given that my wife is breastfeeding and I (and all other passengers) paid a ticket that included a meal. For clarity I would also like to say that the aircraft we flew in was a small A320. Just to make the point that with 3 crew members they could have served everybody with no problem. Conclusion SATA just save ~120 meals, with no care for their cutomers. I am Portuguese, and I am ashamed of this Portuguese airline.

The flight to Lisbon was uneventful of note the way SATA boards their flights: instead of calling the passengers by class, everyone camps right at the gate and so the process becomes a nightmare similar to a herd of bison on a stampede!  The real fun begins on my return to Boston where I had to arrive no later than October 20th at 9 pm. I got to the airport at 10 am, for my flight scheduled to leave Lisbon at 1:05 pm, on October 20th. My bag was checked in, my boarding pass handed to me and then, I was informed that the flight was 5 hours behind without an explanation! I told the SATA representative that I was going on call at 10 pm and had to be in Boston before that! She sent me over to their sales counter where I explained the whole thing again. She was kind enough to route me to a TAP flight leaving Lisbon at 12:45 to Newark where I would then fly to Boston on JetBlue and assured me that my luggage would be taken care of. Upon my arrival in Newark, I could not find my bag so I thought they maybe I would get in when I arrived in Boston. To my dismay I got to Boston and could not find my bag anywhere! I contacted SATA, TAP, JetBlue to no avail! I got an email from TAP and JetBlue, apologizing for the incident and informing me that they would try to locate my bag. I spend most of Saturday and Sunday calling SATA in Lisbon, Ponta Delgada, and Boston being given contradictory information stating that it was not their problem because I flew TAP and JetBlue. I explained to the persons that I handed my bag to a SATA employee and had a baggage claim to prove it! That was of no use. The folks in the US basically told me to get lost because it was not their problem even though I have been flying SATA for almost 20 years! My brother in Lisbon spent hours at the airport, trying to locate the bag, since, in accordance with safety rules a bag cannot fly without the passenger so we were hoping that the bag was lying somewhere in Lost & Found in Lisbon. After several hours, he was told that they could not help him. I kept calling my agent, SATA, TAP, JetBlue without any luck. On Monday, October 23, I got a phone call from Logan Airport, Lost & Found letting me know that my nag was found on the SATA carousel and luckily, it had my contact info on the pocket so they were able to contact me so I could come and get my bag! I did go back to Logan to get it and, to my surprise, they were right: the bag flew on my original SATA flight, un-accompanied, was never opened or checked to make sure it did not pose a threat to the safety of the other passengers. Even with the baggage tag, SATA was unable or un-willing to locate and deliver the bag to me! After all, in this day and age where unfortunately so many horrible things happen all the time, I can’t fathom how a real airline can allow for such a breach of security. I called SATA again, explained the whole thing and, to my surprise, there was no attempt to offer an explanation or apology and so I decided to not only publish this review but also to open a complaint for an investigation which hopefully will prevent situations that could escalate into a tragedy.",A310-300,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Lisbon via Ponta Delgada,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,October,2017

Long boarding times for such a small flight. Overhead bins were stuffed because the company couldn't be bothered with asking the passengers to let their extra items go to the cargo bay, and didn't care with checking baggage sizes and number of bags per costumer which lead to a lot of passenger not having space to stow their belongings while other carried much more than they paid for. This lead to delays on the departure and lots of confusion and upset passengers. They seemed a bit amature and not profissional ground and cabin crew. At least one of the stewardesses tried to find me space for my, bag. She was in fact one of the nicest I have ever had on this company. Food was plain, boring and uninspiring, consisting in a boring (and rather small) sandwich with not so fresh ingredients (seriously, the lettuce was so dark it looked like it was out of date), a drink, a coffee and some sort of assorted cookies, all terrible and dry. Inflight entertainment was non existent and they only screened a movie about the Azores, in screens to small that no one could actually read the subtitles and with no chance to hear the sound. No wifi options were provided and the stewardess forced me to turn off my phone, even though it was in flight mode, way before the landing, other companies don´t do that.

I found the staff attitude towards customers to be unhelpful and dismissive. Worse yet, when my flight finally arrived, my hand-carry was nowhere to be found. I had to purchase new clothes, toiletries, and other items in order to make it through the rest of my trip. I had to pay for these items out of my own pocket. I was also disappointed in the customer service I received when I reported the lost baggage. The staff was unhelpful and unsympathetic, and it was clear that they did not take my complaint seriously. They refused to give me a claim number by saying that it was not needed. I have tried to contact the airline both by phone and email, but I have not yet been able to speak to any customer service representatives who can provide me with information regarding my hand-carry.

To start, the pros to flying Saudia was the price, seating and it's incredible staff. My flight was extremely affordable relative to competitors and the seats were fantastic due to having a lot of empty seats around. Additionally, inflight crew were  friendly and took initiative in the most authentic way. I felt well looked after in the most genuine way! As for my cons, they dealt with the lack of cleanliness, catering and online infrastructure. My seat from Geneva and to a lesser extent out of Jeddah to Seoul wasn't the cleanest. One of my flights had residual trash in the seat pocket and a lot of dirt was wiped off using a wet towel. Moreover, I get that economy food doesn't have a reputation for being 5-star, but the pasta I had was rubbery, tasteless and inept at hiding the fact that it was mass produced. Finally, Saudia could invest a little in improving their online/app features for requesting special meals as they were difficult to navigate and calling was too much trouble due to prolonged wait times.

A meal is offered for passengers connecting on Singapore Airlines flights but it was inedible and the crew never came to collect them until just before landing. How this airline can be part of the Singapore Airlines group is a real mystery.,A321 Neo,Business,Economy Class,Bangkok to Singapore,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,April,2022
17769,Scoot,2.0,"""after this trip I would think twice.""",2022-01-19,True,"  We bid and upgraded to ScootPlus on the flight to Berlin and thoroughly enjoyed it, but didn't receive option to bid on our return trip and as such paid for seats in the first row of ScootinSilence. Upon boarding realised that ScootPlus was more than half empty and inquired on the rates for an upgrade only to be told we would be charged the full fee of $310. While I understand the logic in a bid where the misc fees already paid for seats, food etc. would boost the chances of securing the upgrade, I don't see the case since we were already onboard, had reasonably comfortable seats, with meals reserved and couldn't take advantage of the additional baggage that an upgrade provided and so didn't proceed. Scoot could have earned additional $362 if both of us had upgraded without incurring additional costs but it didn't happen because of its illogical pricing and many ScootPlus seats were left empty. Mid-flight I walked around the cabin only to realised that many rows of first row seats in economy were empty when it was indicated full when I made my seat reservations. Be it technical glitch or last min cancellations, saving grace would be for the cabin crew to offer to shift me and my partner or the guy next to us given we had indicated that we were unhappy that our row was the only one completely full, but no initiative was taken. I'm also still waiting for my miles from the bid to upgrade to be credited. Yes, it's a miserable 302 miles but Scoot should honour what it promised. Prior to this trip I had many good experience with Scoot and would pick it over many full service carriers, but after this trip I would think twice.",Boeing 787-8,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Berlin to Singapore,2.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,no,January,2022

18031,SilkAir,4.0,"""the worst business class seat""",2019-11-25,True,"  Chengdu to Singapore. Absolutely the worst business class seat I have  experienced. The width of the 2x2 first 3 rows is acceptable, but the legroom is absolutely appalling - less even than I would expect in a normal premium economy seat. Plus limited recline, circa 30 degrees from vertical, upon which when the person in the seat in front of you is reclined you have even less space to maneuver in and out and are pretty much forced to recline yourself to retain a semblance of spacing. Added to which the seat controls for recline, footrest, lumber massage are really stiff mechanical levers. For a brand new plane absolutely abysmal! There is  no in flight entertainment in the seat backs. In business one is issued with an iPad which can stream movies etc. through the Silk Air WiFi. This does not support Internet connectivity, only the IFE. If you want to use your own device you need to have previously installed the Silk Air app from the app store - something nobody tells you before you board. In the cramped seat space there is very little place to put the iPad, even on the little plastic prop available on request, so one ends up holding it whilst also trying to juggle a meal or whatever. No noise cancelling headphones, just cheap in-ear buds, so I plugged my own noise cancellers in to the iPad. No capability to connect via Bluetooth of course. I found it impossible to doze on the 4.5 hours midnight flight so tried to pass the time with the limited selection of English language films on the iPad. Literally the only redeeming feature of the whole miserable experience was the cabin crew who try their best to give high quality and attentive service.

There is no inflight entertainment except that you can purchase the Silk Air studio app and watch a limited range of a fairly pathetic selection of movies.

The seats do not recline enough to withstand a 7 hour flight. The lounge at Cairns is compact but sufficient. The in flight attendants were good but were again stymied by the limitations of the aircraft. There is very limited in flight entertainment.

The flight was canceled after we are at the gate for 4 hours past the departure time without any explanation. Being flown with SQ for many times, I suspect this had to do with JFK rather than the airline. However, they should still bear the responsibility for addressing to their customers. We were rebooked to the non-stop SQ23 to Singapore the following day. We ended up on the A350-900XLR, which was quite nice, but I still prefer their A380.

Why does SQ still have business class seats where the place to put your feet is not in line with the rest of your body? And the transition from bed to sitting is NOT a button push.

18235,Singapore Airlines,6.0,"""rather disappointed""",2023-06-01,True,"  The First Suite has a lot of space and a lot of gadgets, and some fellow travelers might be impressed. I was rather disappointed by the outline and design of the suite. The bed is not in the direction of the travel, but across the suite. It is narrow and very hard. If the bed is in the non-sleeping position, then it just hangs at the wall to the next suite like a white chunk of wood. In order to dine from the table one has to turn the chair towards the aisle, or towards the fellow traveller in the opposite suite (which is not very private, when, as in my case, the door does not close properly). On both legs to and from Sydney there were technical issues in the suite: either the door could not be closed properly, or the entertainment system did not work at all, or not properly, the seat belt did not fit into the mattress, etc. To add as well, that Singapore Airlines seems to have cut the quality and diversity of the food and wine on offer. Only the Caviar was nicely presented and met the quality standard of First Class food. (On my way to Singapore I have enjoyed Swiss and their First Class product. For a frequent traveller their product was First Class all over, (only with the exception of the bathroom). ",A380,Business,First Class,Singapore to Sydney,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,yes,May,2023

However my bulk head seat was not the same/good option as it was on the A350. A380 Business Class bed is rather hard, so not the most comfortable to sleep in.

In an era of self-check in kiosks and self-serve apps, the human touch it provides to all its passengers is remarkably special and the warmth and comfort of the human element is something that is irreplaceable by technology. The cabin crew truly went above and beyond to ensure that the passengers were well looked after. In addition to that, every other aspect of the flight from the checking-in process, lounge, boarding arrangements, punctuality, cabin announcements, seat comfort and functionality, meal service, inflight WiFi and timing and baggage delivery was also seamless and flawless.

I used the premier lounge which is okay for a coffee, boarding from gate 4A was organised, I had seat 58A which is an exit row so pretty comfortable, departed on time for the 2 hour 20 minute flight. Once in the air lunch served which is the regional boxed meal, I think it's a great idea for short flights, food was good served by a really great crew. Arrived SIN little bit early I had to transfer from T3 to T2 which is no problem even had time to visit the Krisflyer Gold Lounge for a coffee and be at the gate for my connection.

Understandable. Less understandable was the disorganized response, which included vague instructions on updates, a lack of transparency on continued delays after weather cleared. The flight departed late and I was told that my luggage would be on my connecting flight, but when I landed in HKG it was not. When I contacted SIA they refused to offer me any compensation for my delayed flight, and asked for an e-ticket number for my original Scoot ticket (e-ticket numbers are nowhere to be found on Scoot ticket receipts or in the booking on the app, which disappears after your flight date).

SQ use the Bidvest lounge which was fine with decent food and seating, boarding was covered quickly so soon at my seat 12A. Once onboard drinks served before departing on time. This flight makes a short stop in Johannesburg where passengers remain on the aircraft, a small lunch served on the first leg by a nice crew. With a new crew departed JNB on time for the 10 hour flight to Singapore, food lunch/breakfast and service during the flight very good as was the seat and TV Options. Arrival in Singapore a little early after a pretty bumpy flight, transfer was fine using the Silverkris lounge in T3 for a coffee and shower before boarding the flight to Bali this time on a 787-10 my favorite SQ Aircraft.

18271,Singapore Airlines,9.0,"""up to their usual high standards""",2023-03-05,True," SQ 212 on B777-300 SYD/SIN ; A350-9 SIN/BKK/SIN & SQ 231 on A380 SIN/SYD. First international flight since covid. Two things stand out - as expected, Singapore Airlines were up to their usual high standards with requests, check-in, seating and efficient, friendly cabin service. Despite aircraft being full, a polite request for preferred seating afforded us seats near bulkheads or in exit rows - making the longer sectors far more pleasant with the extra legroom. Flights departed on time, cabin and toilets kept clean at all times. The 2nd issue of significance was that one of my 2 baggage items was nowhere to be seen upon arrival in BKK. This was at a time when all airlines were ramping up after covid and many were having issues with misplaced, lost or late baggage. In fairness to SQ, the item was ""oversize"" and handled separately AND we had a tight connection of only 1 hour in SIN. It was reported to staff and next morning I received an email saying the smallish item had been located. I received a phone call and then another email updating me of the delayed baggage and that it would be delivered to my home 100km from BKK airport by courier - and it DID arrive as promised !. Excellent communication and service. It was apparent the item had missed the connecting flight in Singapore - as evidenced by the ""rush"" stickers etc all over the article..

So we’ve had best part of 27 hours experiencing the Premium Economy product. Boarding for both flights was painless. Both flights left on time and arrived slightly early. The premium economy cabin on the A380 is right at the front and as such feels quite exclusive. Indeed there are only about 40 seats in the cabin in a 2-4-2 configuration. To keep this review brief. The seats were a major upgrade on the usual economy seats both in comfort and space. The food was lovely - we used Book the Cook for all our meals. Plenty of drinks brought around and if you needed a top up or a snack this was provided promptly. Again on both flights the cabin crew were amazingly good. We paid about £600 each extra over and above the economy fare, which at the time of booking meant our premium economy fare was double the economy fare. So an extra £300 each way to be in Premium Economy. Is it worth it? Well yes it is , but I add a proviso. It’s worth paying extra, as long as the extra you pay is no more than around £600-£700 for long haul return. £600 economy vs £1200 Premium, that a no brainer. If you have the cash then do it. But £600 economy and £1600 Premium, then I’d personally say that’s too much for what you get",A380,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Singapore to London,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,yes,December,2022

The cabin is a spacious 3-3-3 layout in it's Economy Class with excellent mood lighting. The cabins lack individual air vents and can make it uncomfortable sometimes. Food was average and the portions were not great. However, the cabin crew do everything from serving snacks like sandwiches, cup ramen, chips, cookies, etc. to the passengers from time to time with water and beverages. Hospitality was five-star. From the welcome at the door, the crew help out passengers with a smile. Given that they work for hours together on some ultra-long haul flights and with a wide of array of passengers onboard, it is amazing to see them help you with a smile, always.

I was impressed by their professionalism, politeness and friendliness throughout the journey, despite having to serve almost a full flight. Flood (including snacks in between meals at the galley) was plentiful, even for economy class. Two free hours of wifi for economy class passengers was a welcome addition to the service.

Boarding was on time and very efficient, with a personalised welcome on board.. settling in was very easy, as there is so much storage available at the seat and above. Pre take off drinks were offered, but only fruit juice and water, no champagne. No amenity kits offered except by request. Food and drink orders were taken immediately after take off, and serve with sosatie appetisers. Meals were served not long after with a varied choice of mains. Book the Cook is not available ex Johannesburg, and also whilst it is possible to preview the menu, it is not possible to order. Not a problem for us, as we were near the front. Decent wines were on offer, although a somewhat limited choice. Food was good, as was the service. The seat is very comfortable and notably wider than most. Flor sleeping it is necessary to fold down the backrest to create the bed, which is easily done, although attendants were quick to help. The drawback to the bed is a small cubbyhole for the feet offset from the bed, although in use this was not a particular problem, and wwe both slept for most of the flight. Breakfast was offered as and when people woke, and arrival in Singapore on time. As usual immigration was a breeze. Our only downside was we found the entertainment system difficult, but this is probably an age thing.

The cabin crew were friendly and efficient and made the flights very pleasant indeed. You do need to ask for amenity kits and slippers if you want them and the absence of an offer of hot towels was initially disappointing but a plentiful supply was discovered in the wash rooms for self-serve. The lie-flat beds were made up by the crew if you showed any hesitation in figuring out how they worked and were comfortable once you became used to the idea of sleeping on a bed where the lower half was offset to the upper half.

After takeoff they started the first service which was tasty and there was selection of wine, beer, drinks. After food was desert which was an icecream. During flight the crew was passing by the bottle of water for the passengers. At the galley there were some sandwiches and drinks. In the WC there were toothbrushes, cologne and cream.

I had noticed there was an anomaly on the original e-ticket regarding the 23kg baggage I had paid EUR60 for in respect of both the outward journey to Palma and the return. The original e-ticket stated that there were 0 pieces for the return from Palma. I emailed Smartwings the day before the outward journey, explaining the situation, and I had a response within three hours confirming 1 pc of luggage for the return from Palma and a new receipt. Nevertheless, at check-in in Palma I was informed I could not check in the case because the record stated there were no pieces of luggage with the ticket. Fortunately, after an anxious few minutes I was able to produce a printed copy of the final and amended receipted I had received on request before the outward journey, and this was accepted. Check-in was opened relatively late, leaving little time at the departure gate despite the 40-minute delay. I travel with Smartwings and CSA regularly. Rarely on time, and there are never apologies for delays. Expensive, especially for a budget airline. On the positive side, plenty of legroom. No food but at least water offered.

So after few years I've decided to fly with Travel Service/Smart Wings again (won't do that for some time again). Since prices from Heathrow were too expensive on this date and I didn't want to fly from Stansted and I wanted it to fly in the evening there wasn't that many options to Prague, so I chose SmartWings. First plane arrived hour late, but with that problems only started. Than boarding started (much later), for some reason they had boarding in 3 sections (for 183 people), first people from back of the plane, I was in front, but when I went to tunnel people were still there, because for some reasons they needed to start boarding from front - they said because of balance of the aircraft, I fly a lot but this is first time I've heard this on boarding. So another delay, than after some time when crew wasn't able to count all the people on board we finally took off and landed hour and 20 minutes after we were scheduled. Than deboarding started and again for the first time in my life I've heard that, we were deboarding from back of the plane, so first people from the back, but using front sky bridge, which took another 20 minutes, so overall time was almost 2 hours and 1 hour is on lack of skills of this so call airline. Only positive is that you got check it baggage, but thats it, they also have wifi and seats were ok, but that won't compensate for all the other things.

I looked over at my wife's meal and she clearly had something different. When we alerted the flight attendant, she looked at my meal and said, ""You got the oysters."" My wife (who was on the aisle) clearly pointed out that we ordered two chicken meals. The foil on top of both of our meals had a blue dot sticker, with one marked in black ""C/Curry"" the other (mine) was not. This was either a mistake on the part of the meal preparation team or a mistake on the part of the cabin staff or both. Yet no apology, just took away my meal and gave me a different one. I am religiously restricted from eating oysters or other shellfish. So this is offensive to me. However, it is apparently not important to Solomon Airlines. A clear mistake. What if I had a shellfish allergy?  Solomon Airlines handling of this was very poor. I cannot recommend this airline.  They spray insecticide in the cabin before landing. Not once, but twice.

My food was unappealing and limited options. Even though it is a flight with a late departure with only a light meal offered for dinner, I found that I was hungry after that service and there were not even biscuits or any sort of snack available. Service was obliging but seems their company has left crew with limited options to satisfy their premium cabin customers. Flight departed and arrived on time.

18644,South African Airways,7.0,"""crew did the minimum possible""",2020-03-12,True,"  Washington to Accra in business class. South African Airways uses TK lounge in Dulles which was jam packed with line ups for the washrooms. Boarding smooth with early departure from IAD. I was initially in 2A, but moved to 9K in the second business class cabin when I saw some kids a couple rows behind me. Big mistake because there was a young woman two rows behind me who wanted everyone to know that she was there and travelling in business class. She fussed over everything, talked loudly from her seat to a passenger behind her, flirted shamelessly with the male cabin crew and in the middle of the flight, when everyone else was asleep, talked a full volume in the galley. I had to get and tell the crew to tell her to shut the hell up. To no avail. Then, on final approach to ACC, she was sound asleep and couldn't be woken up. She was a complete idiot. At one point, she stood in the second galley and pointed to the first, larger business class cabin and announced, ""that must be business class, but where I am (the smaller second business class cabin) must be first class because it is small"". A complete idiot. Shame on the crew for letting her talk so loudly in the galley in the middle of the night. Service was ok but definitely no way near the standard of many airlines. The business cabin was just over half full, but the crew did the minimum possible. When I inquired as to how the seat is made up for sleeping, one FA just pointed at the two packages of blankets/padded cover and said, ""there they are"", as if I hadn't already seen them. No effort at all to help prepare my seat for sleeping. During the meal service, when it was time for dessert, I was asked what I wanted. I said I'd have the cheesecake and the cheese plate, then was told that it was 'company policy' that I could have one or the other. Really? In business class with a nearly half-empty cabin? Food was mediocre overall. I liked the bulkhead seat in the second cabin (row 9) because the foot area is double size, unlike a lot of the new coffin-like business seats where you feel like you are undergoing the world's longest MRI.",A330,Business,Business Class,Washington to Accra,4.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,yes,March,2020

We followed the normal reporting process and e-mailed SAA two weeks ago with no response. We reserved 3 seats for the trip going to New York and our return flight back to JHB. Before boarding this flight I phoned SAA and raised my concerns about on board entertainment systems being faulty which were laid to rest by your call centre lady saying I must request the ground staff to check entertainment systems before we take off to see if our systems are working so if there are technical problems they can be sorted before the plane hits the runway then it would be too late. This however did not prove to be factual at all. Once at the terminal the staff on the plane were rude and told us the systems could not be checked until the plane was in the air. So we sat back and waited hoping all would be okay until the emergency demonstration had been done and the entertainment systems started getting switched on then we started to see the overhead lights coming on one after the other. At this time we were still trying to figure out how to pull our entertainment systems from under our seats. With our luck Seat 45D had a picture but no sound. Seat 45E and 45F no picture or sound. So we complained with the other 20 or odd passengers at the time so they announced they were going to reboot the system. This happened twice. No change. The plane was not full so they started to move passengers around to seats to where there were screens to see if they could find available entertainment. My friend was moved twice and then gave up due to not being successful and came back to her seat next to me. The air was so hot where we were sitting we could not take it another minute so we called the air hostess who said she could not understand why it would only be our row. She came back later and said afterwards that there was a distinct temperature difference between the rest of the plane and our section and she would try and resolve it for us. She was very apologetic and accommodating. We were hoping that our return flight would be on a different plane as we checked and saw SAA has a few of these planes on their fleet and thought the likelihood of getting such bad luck a second time running in one trip would be unheard of. So we still went for the extra legroom and kept our reserved seats that we paid the additional R750.00 per person for, and lo and behold on flight SA204 departing from New York the seats I reserved again this time no sound no picture And a sweat box for the full flight.",A340,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Johannesburg to New York,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,January,2019

18715,South African Airways,8.0,"""Really impressive service""",2017-08-19,False,"  East London to London via Johannesburg. Really impressive service on SAA to deal with a late departure on a domestic flight by an hour with an already tight connection onto a long haul flight from Johannesburg. On boarding and making the cabin crew aware of my concern, they smiled and reassured that I would make it no problem. This was confirmed when the captain announced during his pre-take-off message that he was aware of a passenger connecting to London, (and some others onto Munich), that he had alerted this to the ground staff in Johannesburg, and that there would be staff waiting at the gate on arrival to whisk us through to the connecting flights - exactly that happened! It was a pleasure to see everything work as promised, and took the stress out of a worrying situation. SAA must be commended (somehow despite their near bankruptcy - but that is another story!) for offering generous food and alcohol (giving two bottles of wine instead of one; two liqueur miniatures etc) on their flights - a notable contrast to their two competitors Virgin and BA on this route where cost cutting is so obvious. Cooked breakfast and three dinner options still offered, and flight attendants that enjoy their jobs and want to serve their customers. Only gripe was on boarding on the return at LHR, five people were struggling to locate their seats (a family had been split up across the totally full plane), and no staff were present or visible to assist - they all were in the galley before takeoff chatting, and when I went back to let them know if someone could assist they looked irritated... Small blemish though on 4 very good flights.

SAA staff, particularly in the business class lounge, were rude and incompetent. They could not explain the layout of the airport, an important skill one would assume when the airport has no maps and the point of departure for Flight SAA 280 changed back and forth from Gate A15 to A01 to A18, a journey of several hundred metres through and around retail outlets. After several delays we were allowed to board the aircraft only to discover that the baggage handlers had loaded the stowage bins for the forward compartment into the rear of the aircraft and vice versa, not a comfortable mistake when the aircraft is facing a 10 hour flight over the Indian Ocean. The skipper explained to the hot, tired and thirsty passengers that the reshuffling of the containers would take 10 minutes, in fact it took 40, and to add insult the only in-flight entertainment was a tumbling kaleidoscope of photographs, projected on small screens, of apparently happy and competent ground staff.

18767,Southwest Airlines,3.0,""" lack of concern from Southwest""",2023-05-20,True,"  I am quite disappointed with Southwest. I and several members of my company have been flying Southwest for the past several years because the service and convenience had been exemplary particularly when taking into account the reasonable pricing. I have seen its attributes in many way degrade and some of the competitors improve their standards. I was particularly dismayed after having left my briefcase and phone on a flight on May 16th, 2023. After filing a lost report soon after deplaning, I received no helpful assistance from the airline other than an email three days later stating that they were looking into it and should consider the case close if no further notice had been received withing 30 days. Misplacing a phone these days does not only cause a significant financial impact but the information contained may be critical. For this reason, a more definitive answer than the nonchalant response from Southwest baggage supervisor at Midway Airport stating that they would be drowned in lost items that they receive daily then added 40-50 things including I-Pads, phones, and other items. This statement struck me as particularly irritating since the two individuals at the office were sitting without no apparent task at the time. With the concern that she displayed, I must conclude that the case is probably lost and that the decision to purchase another phone (regardless of cost) should be undertaken. I would have hoped that they might ask me to text my phone to more quickly identify the fact that they may or may not have it in their procession now at the Alabama location where all the lost items from all the Southwest flights go (now many thousands of items per day instead of 40-50).

But - if you do the math - Southwest is lost a TON of money due to the Christmas Flight debacle last year.  An average soda costs about $0.75 - $1.00 for the airlines, once you factor in the cost of the drink itself (they purchase cans), the cup, and the ice (which isnt much).  On average a flight has about 150 passengers - that's easily $112 - $150 they can put in their pocket when they ""cancel"" beverage service - and that's assuming each passenger only has one drink. On a recent flight (the one I'm on as I write this) - we were once again denied this ""freebie"" service in the name of supposed ""turbulence"" despite a relatively smooth flight.  I've heard others mention that the captain is the one who makes that decision, so I asked. When I asked about this, instead of simply answering my question, letting me know that the captain made the decision, etc. the flight attendant said something like ""let me find out"".   A few minutes later, the captain came on and ""explained"" why he felt it was important to cancel service - essentially providing an excuse for why they did this.  When I asked for the captain's name, so i could verify this with SWA customer service, I was met with another flight attendant who basically told me ""were not going to do that"" and refused to give me his name. He also threatened that they would ""divert the plane""  although I was extremely calm and was seated in my seat, not yelling or anything.  I guess I was talking loud enough for other passengers to hear - can't have more than one passenger figure out the little secret. Although I dont know what they are so worried about.  Most of the passengers on the plane will never even tell their friend or a significant other about the experience, let alone do anything that could actually make a difference (like report this on social media or via customer service). But still you dont have to ""hide"" and refuse to provide your name if you aren't doing anything wrong.  So this is all being done in the name of ""safety"" - lets go with that.

So I think I'm going to request that every time I fly now because I pay $100 or so extra to get first choice of seat and overheard, yet that is no longer available because ALL pre borders have forced those who pay extra to sit in what's left.

I was forced to give up my seat to other people after I boarded first as an A class member. Then the airline lost my luggage on my flight home because it turns out they decided not to put it on the plane and when I was told it would arrive and I would be contacted I wasn't. I was called at 12am and woken up. Then I had booked a flight home Dec 22-29 to fly home after life saving surgery to spend Christmas with my family until my flight was canceled twice so I ended up having to spend Christmas alone and lost money due to paid appointments thanks to Southwest. I rebooted my flight and requested assistance which was not given after I specifically told them I couldn't lift per Dr. Orders but didn't get help until second time where I had to go through security again andI had to pay fora carry on bag. I was told I would get a flight credit due to SW canceling my trip because they sent my mom one. When I called to ask about it again they told me I don't get one after I had been waiting for the email I was promised. I am beyond disgusted as a customer and if the situation is not handled I will not be using SW again and will make sure to tell everyone I know not to use them either. They are a dishonest company who doesn't care about their customers or taking care of them as promised. I understand mistakes happen but what happened to me is not acceptable and won't be tolerated. I deserve respect and for SW to keep their word.  I'm tired of being told no one will do anything for me.

The flight was scheduled to land at Shirdi at 4.50pm. Instead, the flight landed at Mumbai at 5.30pm. Announcement was made just before landing at Mumbai. Reason given was storm at Shirdi when actually there was no storm and 3 different flights from Chennai, Tirupati and Vizag (including one ATR) landed around the same time. This was confirmed from local authority at Shirdi. Passengers were in the aircraft for more than 3 hours in Mumbai, during this period there were only 2 announcements, 1st announcement after 1 hour of landing in Mumbai that flight will be taken to Nashik as it could not land in Shirdi after dark. 2nd announcement after 3.5 hours was that passengers were given 3 options: Option 1: stay at Mumbai for the night and go to Shirdi next day. Option 2: Go to Shirdi by bus. Option 3: Go back to Delhi and fly to Shirdi next day. There was utter confusion and no clarity. Passengers lost their patience and naturally got furious. We were deboarded in Mumbai airport around 9.00pm. It took one hour to collect the checked-in luggage as different ground crew announced different conveyor belt Nos (No 1,4,14 and finally 13). Ground staff signed and put stamp on the boarding pass of the passengers after writing full refund of the to ticket charges. On requesting for refund through mail, SpiceJet authorities refuse to refund citing the reason for rescheduling of flight (mail from SpiceJet attached). This is totally misleading information and mismanagement by SpiceJet treating their customers as fools and commodity. SMS/Mail from SpiceJet was about cancellation of the flight which was not correct. The loss of time, mental stress, fatigue and poor communication and misinformation by the Pilot can not be compensated in terms of money. I had already blacklisted SpiceJet earlier because of their poor service.. No wonder SpiceJet is on the verge of collapse and shutting down looking at their quality of staff, meals, aircraft and service. A complete failure of structure, process and outcome indicators.

Nothing worst than an airline cancelling your flight and then being treated like they're doing you a favor. Then the only way to make a complaint is to write an email to their terrible non-existent customer service. The only way to talk to a Spirit agent is to book flights (to take your money).

The toilets were also kept clean which was an improvement on my last journey. In flight entertainment was adequate although not the largest selection around. Price return from Sydney to London was very competitive and less than premium economy on some other carriers. One slight draw back is the long transit time in Colombo however the airline accommodates travellers in an off airport hotel so for me, an afternoon lazing by a pool in Colombo is well worth the savings in fares.

At 10pm we were told it was delayed until 7am the following day. There was utter chaos and no one knew what was going on. Eventually we got told we would be put into a hotel for the night.

We asked if we could get a refund, they said they could not guarantee anything.

My wife and I visited the Sri Lankan office at the World Trade Centre at 9.30am on 12th August, to reschedule my flight since I do not have sufficient time for the connecting flight from LHR (0.35mnts). I was told by the agent the delay is due to re-fueling in COK. I was assisted by a trainee staff member who was not knowledgeable and understanding her position. She said cannot help me and since the ticket was issued in Canada and there are no seats in any of the SriLankan flights, it needs to be rescheduled in Canada. Subsequently I spoke to the Air Canada office in SL and they too advised that Sri Lankan needs to reschedule my flight. At this point of time another agent came to the rescue of the trainee agent and stated that I was supposed to come within 24hrs of receiving the mail. We stated that the mail does not specify this requirement. Moreover, the next day of receiving the mail was a holiday in Sri Lanka. She was so arrogant and argumentative the way she spoke to us. The agent said she will try to get four seats on the 18th flight however we need to get the tickets issued within one hour. I said it is around 2.00am in Canada.

Her phone contained her electronic boarding pass, all her contacts, and essentially her only way of contacting me (a significant blow since I would be picking her up in Auckland). Naturally, she was beside herself.

Sri Lankan Airlines was able to help in several ways.

I would like to thank the Sri Lankan Airlines staff member who conveyed that message and reassured my mum. They kept me apprised of all the updates including the alternative flight.

That said, it is not the cancelation, it is how they handled it is where the train came off the tracks. We were stranded in a foreign county and they did not provide any assistance to help us find lodging or grand transportation. It was a challenging situation to say the least. I had requested flight communication via text. They sent and email, which I did not check before leaving our resort for the airport as 7:00 AM. We would have simply stayed where we felt safe if proper communication had occurred. It is their customer service. The worst experience of my life.

19327,Sunwing Airlines,1.0,"""never fly Sunwing again for a vacation""",2022-11-15,True,"  I am absolutely disappointed with Sunwing. When we booked our trip with two little kids and a tall husband we upgraded to the front of the plane. Normally they have people stand behind the elite plus seats stand behind in economy to wait for the washroom. Instead they allowed them to stand in our leg room to wait for the bathroom. The flight attendants were not impressed to be working, and were made if anyone came through the curtain to use the bathroom as they were gossiping and reading magazines. We knew that meals were not served but there has always been an option to buy onboard meals, they clearly outlined that there is only snack available - for a 6 hour plane ride. They came through twice offering water - in 6 hours, and were annoyed at that. Then the real kicker, we land in Montego bay at 315pm. We go through customs, get our luggage and head outside to our bus. Waiting on the hot bus until 4:30 they offered us $5USD beer. When they finally started driving we were in rush hour. A 1 hour 15 min bus ride took us 3.5 hours. They lied to us and said it wouldn't be much longer but we would be stopping for a break, which added another half hour to our trip. After sitting in the airport for 2 hours, sitting on a plane for 6 hours, and then a bus for 4 additional hours (wait time, break and rush hour driving) -- We were not impressed. We all grabbed a sandwich for the plane (which was not refrigerated) ate at lunch and then didn't get a meal until 730pm. NOT IMPRESSED. On the way home the bus came to get us 2 hours late, no one told us our plane was delayed, so we sat in the lobby waiting, then when the bus arrived they took us to the airport where the sunwing representatives were annoyed and rude. And again on the way home the flight attendants were annoyed to be working, and allowed people to stand in our space as we upgraded our seats again. Shame on you Sunwing for not appreciating your customers, shame on you for sending us in traffic at rush hour, when you could move flights by two hours either way to avoid the whole situation. Not impressed and will never fly Sunwing again for a vacation. I realise you are cutting costs wherever you can, but not offering children something other than $7 pringles is insane to me.

The rides to and from the airports and hotels were excellent as well. They were coaches and were on time both ways. The Bad: - The Edmonton Airport's signage is terrible and Sunwing booking agents aren't there until 3 hours before any flight so it's difficult to to know where you should be unlike other airlines or other airports. We were delayed 9 hours leaving from Edmonton, while we know others we met on our journey were delayed up to days of delays. We were delayed 1 hour leaving from Cancun. Notifications were received by myself but our travelling buddies who were signed up, did not. Then all of a sudden days later, they did? On the plane to Cancun we were in row 8. They ran out of most everything by the time they got to our row! Are you kidding me! On the plane to Edmonton we were in row 10 but it didn't matter because all they had were junk food, pop, tea, coffee and water.

They treat customers worse than cattle. They will not take your luggage to your destination because they carry cargo, and have no space for customers’ bags. Of course you find out about it after arrival. Right now we are stuck in Camaguey, Cuba because those greedy crooks changed the departure time from 11.10 am to 18.10, added 2 extra hours for an unscheduled stop over, and on top of that the plane is late 3 hours. It may still be further delayed. Instead of arriving in Toronto at 14.10, right now it looks like we might arrive at 2.30 am at the earliest the next day.

19487,Swoop,1.0,"""Avoid this company if you can""",2022-12-24,False," The booking for travel on the 23rd was made as far back as October. The weather became very bad, and after numerous re-scheduling, the flight was finally fully cancelled for the 23rd of Dec. I had no choice but to inform my family who were waiting for me at the Edmonton airport that I was not travelling to Alberta this year. They then left the Edmonton area and drove off to Red Deer, Alberta about two hours away from Edmonton to celebrate Christmas. Swoop Airlines send me an email on the 24th indicating that they had rebooked me on one of their flights departing Abbotsford on the 24th. I had no way of travelling from Edmonton to Red Deer, so it made no sense for me to fly to Edmonton on the 24th. Apparently as it turns out, Swoop gets to keep my money, since this was a weather related cancellation and they offered me a flight a day after the day of my planned travel. I have flown with Swoop on numerous other previous occasions. It was tolerable for a short one hour flights. Generally pretty awful company and cabin habits of the cabin crews leave a great deal to be desired. Plus this policy of; The hell with your money, we offered you a flight the next day, if you didn't take it, that's not our problem, so we are keeping your money. Naturally I won't be getting my $577.00 back. So that 's a huge loss. But I don't ever have to travel with this company. There are other options. Avoid this company if you can.

19527,Swoop,1.0,"""Terrible customer service""",2022-09-27,True,"  Terrible customer service, you can't actually speak to a human, their auto-bot replies come weeks after you make an inquiry & after going back & forth for 8 weeks I'm not entitled to any cost reimbursement for our trip despite paying for the additional medical or baggage insurance. Also our return flight was delayed. I was traveling for business while my family was tagging along for a vacation. I thought this would be low cost option however by the time you pay for all the fees (don't forget to pay for your seat selection so your aren't separated from your child - as stated right on their booking website?!?!) and ALL baggage - carry on included, it works out to be the same or more than flying with a real airline. Lesson learned however it meant getting the times required so I figured lesson learned. Next I paid for Swoop's extra baggage & cancellation insurance (provided by CHUBB Insurance Brokers) just in case. Prior to leaving our one family member fell ill and was subsequently diagnosed with lung cancer. To accommodate specialist appointments our travel dates changed and the affected family member was no longer going to join the trip - I couldn't simply modify the booking but was advised by the customer service department for the CHUBB Insurance (Swoop's bot directed me here) to rebook the flights for the new dates & submit for reimbursement to their claims department after we returned. However, you cannot simply book for only those going but rather for the entire party even when 1 passenger is no longer going on the trip. At flight check in time, we had to advise the boarding desk of the 1 passenger not joining (should be a simple task) however take off was still delayed both ways as the check in desk didn't inform the flight crew so they were trying to track down the missing passenger. All on board purchases were very expensive & must be paid for by credit card. The plane itself was very small & seats felt cheap & uncomfortable. The onboard wifi was choppy and kept cutting out and the cabin crew were very rude. On return departure a ground crew member was complaining loud enough that us other passengers could hear how annoyed they were at having to help a passenger onto the plane that was in a wheelchair! I have flown other budget airlines before and found their service & planes much better. So since nothing (flight change fee, new flights for all 4 passengers even though only 3 were traveling, additional insurance) was reimbursed even though I paid extra for this optional insurance, I am now out $3348.17 plus the costs of the multiple physician notes the insurance adjusters kept requiring (had to send in 4 different notes over the course of the 8 week claim battle). This company and it's optional insurance is a joke. Way to take people's money for nothing. I am hoping to save someone else their hard earned money.

Quick landing over beautiful Flores (which itself is just a tiny island in lake Peten Itza) and taxi to the terminal. Only carry-on so thru to the exit and off to Tikal. The return was the same (6:30pm departure) except to pay the departure fee of QZ20 (about 3 US dollars) and then go through ""international screening security"" to the gate.

We were going Business class as a treat and at the boarding gate the agent who also checked us in at Milan advised us that we would not be getting meals on the flight as we booked too late for them to add meals for us, even though we booked that flight that morning.

Premium boarding was not premium as many ""friends"" could board in priority (they look very intimate). My seat on brand new A330NEO was broken. Fortunately their were empty setas, and we may understand why. IFS was full of old movies. NO games. Food was OK though. During all flights crew was very nice, and tried to provide all efforts to compensate the running down of their airline. A shame.

19890,TAP Portugal,1.0,"""horrible planes, horrible staff""",2023-01-15,False," This airline is a shambles, there is not one positive I can think of with the three flights I took with them. At check-in told the flight was overbooked and we could not be issued proper boarding passes, we are a family of 5 so had little hope of all getting seats. Staff didn't care at all and just shrugged their shoulders making out it was our fault for not checking in online. On the flights we did eventually get on they were cramped and uncomfortable. Cabin crew rude and inept in dealing with masses of hand baggage and no locker space. Their solution was to walk away and leave passengers puzzled; the result was we took off late and in dangerous conditions with people sitting sideways, legs in the aisle as wheelie cases were rammed under seats in front. On the return we had a connection in Lisbon - big mistake. First flight was an hour late so we had 20 minutes to catch the next plane. TAP did nothing to help, no assistance, no one there to direct us on arrival and not even an advance notice of what gate to go to. We did catch the next flight but only because that was delayed too. If you are thinking of booking this airline - don't! If you have an option to fly someone else, even if slightly more expensive take it. The journey will be a nightmare from start to finish with TAP, horrible planes, horrible staff and no concern for passengers or their safety.",E-195,Family Leisure,Economy Class,London to Porto via Lisbon,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,January,2023
19891,TAP Portugal,1.0,"""decreasing the quality"" ",2023-01-14,True,"  The Portuguese carrier staff since years has worsened its onboard services.While other airlines are improving their services TAP is decreasing the quality. Flight TP016 from REC to LIS (2 hours of delay) on 13.01.2023 in business class. No one aspect of the whole service can be claimed as business service. The REC-LIS route is the only direct service from Recife to Europe. TAP is a monopolistic carrier. If you want to fly to REC with other airlines you need to go through GIG or GRU. The flight then becomes very long. When you fly to REC with TAP they do not care at all. No competition no service improvement. - No welcome drink once a board - Very poor menu. The breakfast is even worst than the dinner. A tiny small of fruit salad and a small plate with two slices of cheese and one of Brie type of cheese.Half slice of very low quality ham (not edible at all) and one slice of salami. I asked for a coffee with milk and they tried to give me powder milk. After a complaint the “normal” milk appeared and was served directly from the box. Bread selection out of any comment - Unfriendly and rude staff. The staff is always in a rush when they have to serve the meals. After the fast services they start chitchatting behind the curtains. They don’t smile at all. It looks they are going to a funeral.  The toilets have No difference with the Economy one. No hand cream, nor refreshing towel or other little amenities. - The internet connection was not available - The only positive thing that cannot offset the whole bad service is the lie-flat bed.

No gluten free meal, but they offered me the guinea fowl which was tasty. I felt ok. There was cheese and desert which I could not eat. The purser really apologized, and he genuinely felt bad about it. Cabin not present, but if you asked for something it was promptly delivered to your seat. The port served was wonderful.

They provide lunch right after the take-off (around noon-ish Lisbon time), after that there is no food for 9 hours. The food option is also mostly carb in economy class. The real problem was after landing in SFO. It took a while to get to the get after landing, not TAP's fault. After immigration, people gathered around baggage claim. After 10 minutes bags started to show up - wait, only 10 bags came and they all belonged to the crew! We waited another 15 minutes, no sign of any other bags. We asked the TAP stewards and stewardess who were also waiting but nothing came out. Another 20 minutes passed, we asked CBP, United Customer service, called TAP phone number, no solution - no one knows! The Stewards went to their hotels and we were thinking of doing the same but there was no guarantee that TAP would deliver them to your home! Finally the bags came after 1h 15 min! No TAP reps were visible during this entire time. They never picked up their phone. United rep announced on PA system several time to TAP reps come and talk to the passengers without any result.

So we flew on the Boeing 777-300er and came back on the Boeing 777-300erwhich was older and dated tvs and cabin unlike the amazing (77y) with a luxurious cabin new interior and modern tv screens on seat back.

20031,Thai Airways,9.0,"""90% of what they used to be"" Kamapin",2023-01-28,False,"  I had booked this trip as a miles trip due to expiring miles, & the cash tickets for these flights were quite expensive. Since we were ROP gold members, we could use the priority counter, which has been relocated to row H at Suvarnabhumi airport, it used to be at row B. Check in was smooth, & since we were flying to Japan, the agent asked if we had filled out Japan Pass - which made us clear immigration and customs really quickly in Nagoya. During the evening, The Royal Orchid Prestige lounge was extremely crowded, however we did find a corner to ourselves far from the main food area, but close to the bar & Halal food area which had fewer options. There was more than enough food and we weren't hungry when the flight took off - so we could get more sleep. I also used a shower suite, where L'occitane liquid soap and shampoo were provided. Boarding was an absolute mess, the crew was late & some passengers did not get their documents properly checked. This was made worse by the fact that gate C1 had very little seating, and lots of passengers ended up sitting on the floor waiting for boarding. We had paid extra to get extra-legroom seats (about 50 USD each) and they were worth it. The purser suggested that I move to the empty exit row seats in the second cabin so that my mum and brother could have a bit more space and comfort. This made the flight much more comfortable for them. I hate short overnight flights, and a departure time of 00:05 wasn't great - no alternatives either. Most of the passengers were asleep before the flight even took off, but I had stayed awake to get a bloody mary from the crew - who bought me one from the galley. Pre-pandemic, Thai Airways had a policy that they would have to serve their gold frequent fliers first. I am very glad that they kept this policy & I was asked whether I would like Omelette with sausage or Shrimp Pad Thai. I chose the Shrimp Pad Thai - which was very tasty & flavourful. I jokingly asked if I could get a cappuccino - which is normally only available for business class passengers. The FA said that she would try to get one for me - which she did, & I asked to be woken up for the meal service. 2 hours prior to landing in Nagoya after some tossing and turning, I was politely awoken & had my breakfast placed on my tray. The crew were all very nice on both flights. On the return flight we flew out from Sapporo/Chitose. The contract lounge in Sapporo had little in the way of amenities or food. Boarding was much better organised on this flight, and we had our meal orders taken after being seated, stewed chicken with mash potatoes or spicy fish curry with rice. I tasted both on this flight and both were very tasty, albeit the fish used is pangas, which isn't that great. Thai used to serve seabass which tastes much better. The highlight of the meal was the cake - a simple vanilla sponge but really tasty. Before landing we were served a spinach pie, which was also tasty but I would've preferred chicken. There was a small issue I had with the crew, on this flight, I found out the tray table wasn't clean when I looked at it during boarding, & the purser walked through & told me to close it for departure - but I pointed out the wet table to her & she called one of the FAs to wipe it up. Entertainment is slightly lacking - they could do with a few more films. Thai is still a great carrier, maybe not as great as the pre-pandemic Thai Airways, I feel like they're 90% of what they used to be in 2019.",A350-900 / Boeing 787-8,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to Nagoya,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,yes,December,2022

It seems that the Thai staff have been told not to offer anything to customers - the air hostess made an excuse that due to COVID that we could no longer have champagne until after take off. Throughout the trip the staff were hiding, and very rarely came round to offer any snacks, drinks unless asked!

If you want to enjoy having an extremely unpleasant journey, I recommend you to take Thai Lion Air. This airline seems to want making money with every little thing they can. Watch out if the weight your luggage might be a bit more than you paid in advance (If you had the luck and prepaid for it at all). The fees for overweight luggage are extremely high. Thus ending up paying more than the original ticket price is not uncommon. When I took this airline from Bangkok to Surat Thani, most of the people seemed to pack everything they could into their hand luggage for not having to pay these fees. For quite a few passengers, there was hardly any space left. This is not only uncomfortably and shows a lack of customer care but is a safety risk as well. My flight was delayed because of bad weather conditions but even though the screens showed a delay, the staff wasn't informed about it at all when we asked them. Apart from that, I wonder why people who can hardly speak any English at all can qualify to work at an airline like this. Nevertheless, they have a strict no food policy and the seats are narrow and cannot recline. There are plenty of much more pleasant airlines going to their destinations too.

On the day of departure I went to the airport prepared to be charged a fee for un-booked luggage (expecting double or triple charge), but upon checkin I was met with a luggage charge of 320 US$ - equal to 13 times the pre-booked rate and double the price of the entire plane ticket. The staff were uninterested in the fact that their webpage didn't work. Long story short - I decided to buy an entirely new ticket for the same flight with 20 kgs included (150 US$). Having once again fallen prey to Lion Air's scams, this was definitely my last flight with that airline. Taking into consideration the airline's atrocious safety record and appalling business methods, I don't recommend anyone using this airline unless there are no other alternatives.",Boeing 737-900,Business,Economy Class,Bangkok to Denpasar Bali,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,February,2019

20197,Thai Lion Air,5.0,"""expensive Premium Seat scam""",2019-02-06,True," Bangkok to Krabi. Thai Lion are both long haul, low cost, no-frills airlines. They get you where you want to go, usually more or less on time, at very very attractive prices. Our team of 15 pax flies often on their domestic and international routes and since we’re usually quite satisfied we’ll continue to do so but don’t fall into the trap of their expensive Premium Seat scam. All their seats are the same. They all have the same width and the “pitch” (the distance for your legs to extend between your row and the row in front of you) is identical in all the rows. At high extra additional prices they sell “Hot Seats”: rows 1-5 in red color, in the front. The seat size is identical but they promise “Priority Boarding” (you’ll be first on) and Priority Disembarkation (you’ll be first off). I attach their promises. The respect neither promise! Being low-cost they rarely use “elephant trunks” (those mobile passageways which for disembarkation allow you to walk directly from the plane to the gate, or for boarding from the gate to the plane). Instead of the elephant trunks they use busses for the transfers to and from the plane. Only One bus is used and all the pax board and disembark simultaneously. No priority whatsoever. When they do use an elephant trunk they board rows 1-20 simultaneously, without any priority or, even worse, they board the back rows first. Thereby, if you’ve been dumb enough to pay for their “priority boarding” you’ll be the last pax to board and you’ll find the overhead bins, in your own front rows, all already fully packed and little or no space for your own carry-ons. Conclusion. Do continue flying on AirAsia and Thai Lion but don’t fall into their sneaky scam. Buy regular Seats. Don’t pay extra for promises of Priorities which they don’t deliver.",Boeing 737-900ER,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to Krabi,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,yes,February,2019

She then told me that she wasn’t able to get a payment from my card. She tried to charge me without telling me! She insisted 3-4 times and was very rude. She took my credit card from my hands and when I was asking her of what she was doing I didn’t get a reply! Really, is this your customer service? She told me the extra charge was 65£ but then charged me 130£ Without telling me and I saw it as soon as I boarded the plane!  Why were we treated like that?

I checked on the punctuality of this route and found that the plane often took off about 15 minutes early but almost always arrived on time or a bit earlier. That was the case with my flight. Cabin baggage in economy is limited to 6 kg. My carry on bag was easily 15 kg but since I was not checking a bag I figured that once I checked in I would simply print my boarding pass and go directly to the gate. I know Logan airport well and there are no scales at the gates. But I was wrong. It is impossible to print a boarding pass from home. Everyone must go to the check in counter. Because of this, I had to check in one bag and make sure that my carry on was under 6 kg. I also put my laptop in another small bag which the check in person didn't see. Once my bag was weighted no one ever questioned it or inspected it. I could have had a friend waiting for me and simply stuffed my bag after checking in, or simply left my bag with my friend and arrived with no bag whatsoever. So beware. You must be careful as they weigh all carry on bags at Boston. The flight was fine. Free meal (chicken or beef) and free muffin and coffee before landing. Everything else costs money. Cans of beer were 4GBP! No individual screens on the seat backs, just drop down screens like in the 1970s. No problem. Seats were a bit tight but otherwise fine. Staff was lovely. For 139GBP one way from Boston to the UK, it was a bargain. Great deal and I would fly them again. Just bring a book or some thing to keep you occupied. Bring a bottle of water.

We thought that they should have electronic check-in by now but they still rely on their paperwork. A boarding pass on an iPhone would have been simple and easy. The extra leg room seats were towards the rear of the aircraft. The seat did look like it had additional leg room. However, it is the most uncomfortable seat I have sat in, in my life. We had a 10 hour flight ahead of us and we could not get comfortable whatsoever. We could not sit together which I found disappointing. We had to sit behind one another. The toilets are few and far between with only 4 single onboard (for economy use). These were in constant use from the moment the plane took off to the moment we landed. This naturally creates a queue in the isle of people waiting to use the toilet. The food was basic going out to Cancun and coming back it was awful. We couldn't eat it. The entertainment was very basic with a few films being offered to watch. Make sure you take two pinned headphones with you as these weren't provided on our flight. There is no WiFi on the flight but there is a power socket for your iPhone. The flight coming back was only 8 hours because of 'jet streams' however, they made sure we left 1 hour later, so we didn't arrive before schedule. To summarise, a cheap flight where they have maximised profit by 'ramming' it full of paying passengers going on their holidays! Very, very poor. I would not recommend or use Thomson Airways long haul again. They have invested in the Boeing 787 but gone for the cheap options.

The return flight from Barbados to Gatwick was appalling. We were in aisle seats, one behind the other. Both seats were directly underneath the overhead ventilation slot for the air conditioning. The slots dripped water onto our heads for two hours without stopping. I complained to a member of the cabin staff and asked to move to another seat. I was told that there were no spare seats and that they would come back to me in a moment. They did not return. Several other passengers, including my partner in the seat in front had to suffer this. I had to sit with a newspaper on my head with drip, drip, drip every 5 seconds for two hours - totally unacceptable. If this is an example of a Dreamliner then Thomson bought the wrong aircraft.

Entertainment choice was very poor. Would recommend Thomas Cook, or United who I've had much better experience flying with. Best thing about Thomson is their pay £15 to choose your seat deal. They endeavour to sit parties together where possible. Given it's a 3x3x3 set up, it's understandable that parties may be split across the aisle from each other as some people have kids etc. Best thing was, they sit you on complete opposite sides of the aircraft, seat C and seat G. Not to worry, upon take off you're given a strict warning not to cross over from one side of aircraft to the other. However pay us £15 each and they magically conjure up seats 13 C and 14 C.

Also on return the benefit of being allowed off before economy class was just ignored - they just let everyone rush off together, a bit annoying as that is what you pay for. Thought food was basic but filled a gap. There is obviously problem with Thomson and staff at Cancun as we were delayed an hour just waiting for buses to take us to aircraft and on landing in Cancun were were ahead of schedule by 45 mins, but had to sit on runway. From overhearing Thomson staff this appears to be a regular problem with Thomson flights and Cancun ground staff. Premuim economy worth it for the seat and fast security at Manchester. given £15 voucher for Manchester instead of lounge which suited me and had lovely breakfast on main concourse. Premium economy was life saver at Cancun as only waited in short queue to book in, whereas economy flights there were three Thomson flights to UK at the same time, and all in one long and winding queue and took hours to book in.",Dreamliner,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Manchester to Cancun,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,yes,November,2015

The audio system was good but could have had more choice in the films. Fourteen days later on return flight the same experience was had with another good cabin crew who looked after us well.

Since the launch of the Dreamliner we have flown out on this wonderful aircraft for the past 3 years but this year it was awful. We booked and paid for this years flights in July 2014 and it was horrendous. At Manchester we had to be taken on a bus to the aircraft then climb the almighty wobbly steps onto the plane, for anyone of limited mobility it was very dangerous. Once on board the miserable cabin crew need to take a course in customer service, they were so grumpy, they shouldn't be doing the job. Please remember we are going to Orlando, families are excited about going to Disney. Menus were flung towards us with the comment its beef or chicken and you may not get the choice you order. Flight back was worse same grumpy staff, awful food, dirty seats, and the fact we had water dripping on us for the whole journey back. Not sure what has happened to this company but we will never use them again as we paid £2,000 for miserable crew, inedible food, dirty seats, dripping water and not to forget the toilets out of action. Our hard earned money is now going to British Airways or Virgin Atlantic.

When I was about to show the e-pass at the gate the mobile website failed to display due to the server being busy. It was not possible to save a copy of the pass to my phone wallet either. Luckily I got a printed one just in case. One thing I was looking forward to was the tigertainment entertainment system which on their website is available on all aircraft. Sadly this was not available on my flights. No wifi signal let alone logging in. No mention of this made onboard. Onboard menu food options had limited options listed but none were available. I was a front row passenger on my flight to Brisbane but even with this my legs were cramped. Cabin crew did nothing to deter someone using one of the spare front seats to wait for the toilet instead of standing even though they hadnt paid for it.

Then buses to the terminal, followed by a long walk from departure area A to F, through an airport that's clearly designed to maximise sales opportunities rather than passenger convenience.

Eventually an employee said business line up over there. And there’s a long line of people who probably were given different info.  Not a huge issue but the bad experience kept getting more irritating. The plane fine, well equipped, very helpful and welcoming staff. But there’s poor info on the website about the seats. Seat map shows 2 seats, an aisle and 2 seats. Seat map of TK website is not accurate, it’s actually one seat, an aisle, two seats, an aisle and one seat. So we were a couple on a 13 hour flight, separated by an aisle and the two seats were offset by approximately 15 inches so we couldn’t even converse across the aisle. Not a fatal flaw but an example of sloppiness. We took off an hour late with no explanation or a “we’re sorry” comment which would have been a nice touch.

The staff were quite welcoming and warm (though, I must admit, during the flight, it was hard to get their attention, and I don't like using the flight attendant call button). The in-flight entertainment was excellent, lots of choice of movies and music, and there was plenty of space (and privacy) in the new pod to rest as well as work comfortably. The food on TK has consistently been excellent, and this flight was no exception; it was truly a feast on board, with so many courses for the main meal after take off, and a fulfilling breakfast just before landing. A wide variety of options, and a very friendly on-board chef to prepare it for you. The wifi was difficult to connect to on my phone, but worked fine on my laptop (it was free for Business Class and Elite passengers) The cabin was clean and also kept immaculate throughout the flight. The check-in and baggage transfer and delivery on the other end went flawlessly--and the IST lounge was an excellent place to rest during the transit (with lots of food and drink options).

I flew on Business class on Turkish Airlines for a roundtrip flight to Bali, Indonesia from Montreal Canada with a connection in Istanbul, turkey. The aircrafts were an Airbus A350 and a Boeing 787 which were nice, spacious and seem in a good condition. The seats had plenty of legroom and space to have a pleasant trip specially on long flights but are similar to other major airlines. One issue about the business class seats is that we can't see from the windows because of the seat conception which is inconvenient for a lot of passengers. The flight attendants were not very service oriented and did not seem very friendly. Usually the crew start to take the meal orders before the plane pushes back but on my last leg they did it once the plane was airborne. The crew from and to Bali legs were a bit better. Some of them don't even ask if we needed something else or a drink during the meal service and they took a very long time take the dishes. I had to ask twice to get my drink and another time later for a coffee which was very long to have it. However the food was tasty and good. The in flying entertainment was also good and had many choices of movies and TV shows. The flights were uneventful but pleasant in general besides the crew with the seat that can be turn into a bed with a big screen tv.

21222,Turkish Airlines,1.0,"""the worst travel experience of our lives""",2023-03-30,True," We were loyal Turkish Airlines fliers for many years until this experience. Our saga started when we purchased 4 business class segments for my wife and my honeymoon in February 2022 for almost $8K. Due to Covid, we tried to change them over the course of the next year. This airline has arbitrary change fees that are not listed anywhere on their website. They are allowed to quote you whatever fees they would like at the time of the change request. As such, we were told that our new tickets would need to be roughly $5600 to qualify for the change, with an additional $600 per ticket change fees, so $9k in total for a $5600 flight. We agreed, but disputed the change fee with Amex. Amex found in our favor for $600, issuing the credit and we looked forward to our honeymoon. Fast forward, we arrived to the gate in February 2023 for our new flight and were told for the first time that our tickets were *suspended* and that we no longer had tickets. After speaking to ticketing agents and phone agents, both of which said there was nothing they could do (more on this later) we finally were able to speak to the Newark sales manager who was highly unprofessional and unhelpful, trying to convince us that we were not owed anything and essentially ""too bad"". In the end, we were forced to purchase last minute economy tickets for almost $4K with a one way upgrade for $2500, as we did not want to jeopardize our hotel reservation and ruin our honeymoon further. Over the course of the next 2 weeks, like many here, we emailed the feedback form many times (as others noted, this airline's phone personnel have no authority to make any financial decisions and all must be done via online feedback forms). We received many unhelpful responses, refusing to give us any compensation or help us in any way. All references were made to speak to ""our bank."" Finally, we decided to upgrade our economy leg home for another $2500 and take this matter up when we got home. In the end, we paid about $8600 just to have to pay another $8.5K and fly in two 8 hour economy segments versus the 4 business segments we originally purchased. I'm sure that in the meantime, Turkish resold our original seats last minute for much higher than the original $8k we paid 5 months before the flight. In short, this was the worst travel experience of our lives and showed clearly the unethical business practices of this airline. 1) They will suspend your tickets without notice, forcing customers to purchase last minute segments at the gate. There are numerous other cases here of flier having their tickets arbitrarily suspended. 2) You will not be able to make changes, receive refunds or do any customer service action of any value through the phone with them. You will be forced to use an antiquated online ""feedback form"" that does not even track your previous correspondence. There are no personnel in any airport, including in Istanbul that have the authority to issue flight changes, credits or refunds. 3) They do not have a clear change fee policy. If you need to change your flight, be prepared to spend months trying to communicate with them on the aforementioned form and in the end they can quote you any amount, you're on your own.

It's a shocker that TK hasn't remotely kept up with their competition in this regard. It's like flying business class in the 1990s. Power ports in inaccessible locations rarely work, seat controls inadequate. So instead of a review of 10/10 I'd love to give, it gets knocked down to 5/10 as a result of all of this. I would not use TK in this configuration unless there was no other choice or the price was very cheap. They desperately need a refresh of this old livery or just new planes.

It was the exact same experience, (minus the bathroom as we were sitting a few rows up) plus incredibly rude flight attendants. We landed pretty early, so waited on the tarmac for quite a while. After some time, I started to feel the urge to go to the bathroom. After 15 minutes I got up to use the bathroom. At that time, a flight attendant turned around and shouted at me ""sit down, you can't get up yet"". We still didn't move for another 5 minutes.

I did and suggested an easy alternative (depart SYD 2 days later instead of adding a 24h layover in Hanoi). They finally responded by email - and didn’t give me what I wanted. Instead, they intentionally added 24h layover. At Sydney airport, staff were not able to change this, not able to check my luggage through, not willing to upgrade me, not prepared to provide any information about what I would do in HAN for 24h or where I would be staying. Upon arrival in HAN, me and 7 other premium economy / economy passengers were made to wait for 2 hours before we were escorted to the WORST AND OLDEST hotel ever, Hotel Victory in Hanoi. That’s when the worst thing happened: We did not get individual rooms but were told to SHARE A ROOM WITH A COMPLETE STRANGER.

21679,Vietnam Airlines,8.0,"""All journeys were consistently good""",2022-12-09,True,"  I flew five journeys with Vietnam Airlines over a period of three weeks, visiting Vietnam from the UK: two international flights (UK - Vietnam & return) and three domestic within Vietnam. All journeys were consistently good, with some features excellent. I booked direct with the company and got a competitive deal, cash sale no points used. Booking process fine, only issue was a necessary & understandable re routing to avoid Russia/Ukraine/Afghanistan airspace which meant a change to connecting domestic flight times. I was given a week's notice of this but had to call their customer service in Vietnam from the UK to rearrange, which was handled well but was an expensive international call. Airport check in all very good, Premium Economy has fast track check in with this airline, with staff polite and eager to help even coming through to security to find me and alter a very minor detail. Any inconvenience was created by official & tedious Vietnamese bureaucracy at their airports rather than the airline itself, with countless levels of repeated and unnecessary security checks by disinterested and brusk stuffed uniforms. Premium Economy seat comfort excellent: room to stretch out even for me at 6ft1in, enough width for proper personal space and a massive recline with leg rest. Not so good the headphones, not noise cancelling and pretty useless, I have poor hearing and even on max volume the surrounding aircraft noise was louder than the entertainment channels, making its use impossible. Also the cabin upholstery and fittings looked slightly worn & tired, with some people's seat features not working; I think a mild re-fit is needed. Food & drink (for an Economy + cabin) was very good, with pre flight juice offered, a prompt towels, drinks & snack service once in the air and a very good main meal served shortly afterwards. A second hot meal served before landing. Crew were ultra professional, friendly and attentive for the whole flight; continually visible & coming through to offer drinks and quick to respond to requests. I woke at one point to find a bottle of water had been left for me in my seat pocket by the crew whilst I was sleeping; I would say the crew were an outstanding feature of a generally very good performance throughout. Comparing the international & domestic flights over this tour, the service on the international legs was noticeably more polished than on the domestic routes not that they were bad at all. Take offs were all quite prompt, the worst one delayed by 40 minutes and two of the five pushing back right on the stroke of the scheduled time. Overall a very solid performance throughout, with airport & flight crew service and seat comfort scoring very highly indeed.

Thank you Virgin America, this worked out perfectly. Re ticketed in minutes, despite traveling on two different records. Given seats together in Main Cabin Select. Boarding was underway when we got to the gate, so we just walked right on board. We checked our bags, so no issue with lack of overhead space upon boarding. Left a few minutes late, then a 30 min ground hold, again due to SFO air traffic. Once in the air, choice of free food and beverages on this short 1 hr flight. Choose the protein snack with cheese and crackers and deli meats, which was excellent and would have not had a problem paying the $8 price tag, if we were in regular coach. I love the order online at our seat option. When the flight attendants get to your row, they simply hand you your choices. Very efficient. Landed 1 hr late in SFO, but still plenty of time for our connection. Spent 1.5 hrs in the Admirals Club, then a 3 hr flight to AUS, with again satisfying food options and beverages with a good choice of movies and shows to make the 3 hr flight time pass quickly.

Actually Sydney to Denpasar flight were not cancel, they sold my ticket to someone else for more expensive. And they took my flights much cheaper fares and flight time is earlier.

Virgin is now almost certainly a budget airline but without the budget prices and is more likely a competitor for Jetstar than Qantas when it comes to service.

The actual aircraft seat is terrible, just a little bit of leg room for 5 times the price of an economy ticket. The drinks consists of “sparkling or water”, no bar service at all. The food is mediocre, would have preferred a McDonalds burger and chips instead. The Business fare keeps going up, while the associated promised food and other perks are minimal or non-existent.

21919,Virgin Australia,1.0,"""they should be providing service and support""",2022-07-13,False,"  Firstly, the booking system is rubbish, such that passengers are not able to manage their booking ourselves and must call through to the customer service. Though they do pick up the call pretty quick, it is pointless as all they can and will tell you is that they can't do anything for you (when they actually can). My husband booked a ticket for me to fly out on a Thursday to see my father in law who has just been hospitalised. However, something cropped up at home and I could not leave till the next day. I called to ask for a change of flight. First time I called, I was told all flights on Friday are sold and so they could not change it for me. I was naïve and believed in it. I even thanked the staff. But it then dawned upon me that I was checking the tickets online earlier and there are still seats available. So I called back again and the staff (I believe it's a different one) told me the same lie, that no seats are available. I pointed out to her that there are seats available online. She then told me a cock and bull story about how the system is not updated online and if customers were to go ahead and book online, they will get an error message. I then questioned them about truthfulness in their product publishing and advertising. It's a hoax then. I was certain they could do something about it and so asked to speak with a senior staff member. She put me through and funnily enough, this senior staff was able to find a seat for me on Friday, when the other 2 staff had insisted that all tickets on Friday were sold. However, I had to pay another $370 to have that changed. When my husband booked the ticket, it was stated that we are entitled to 1 change. The senior staff said ""yes you are entitled to 1 change but you need to pay the difference"". How is that considered ""entitled to 1 change""? As it was too much to pay, I was not sure if I wanted to go ahead or just simply cancel it, as it would cost about the same. Later my husband called them and explained the situation. They were insistent in ""not being able to do anything"" at first. But after my husband's persistently requesting, they finally agreed to a refund in the form of a voucher. This goes to show that they are actually able to provide some form of assistance to help us and there are many options. However, they choose to just tell the customer that they can't do anything and turn the customers away, forcing them to accept the flight or to forgo the ticket. I think these staff have either forgotten or didn't realise that airline is a service industry, they should be providing service and support. Even more so, if they expect customers to call their customer service line, there should be some real help offered.",Boeing 747,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Melbourne to Gold Coast ,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,July,2022

I am begging everyone to not use the program Velocity Frequent Flyer as it’s an absolute joke. They have the right to kick you out if you didn’t pay by money as they count it as a “low flyer”.

No response was received. Airport check in staff either couldn’t or wouldn’t correct the obvious error and didn't seem care even though one person in our group had mobility issues. There response was that they were only responsible for checking in and it wasn’t their problem. So now I have to fill out paperwork to claim a refund for the seating I booked and paid for which was allocated to someone else. Also the people in row 24 were totally ignorant of normal polite inflight protocol and reclined their seats which affected the person in our group with the mobility issue.

Outbound sector was an overnight flight at 0145hrs, Breakfast comprised of an omelette, chicken sausage, and something else. Return lunch was a bowl of curry with chicken,  vegetable and rice. A salad started the meal and a small rasmalai for dessert. Lie flat seats in a 2x2 layout in the narrow body aircraft, with little privacy. There's not much time to sleep so its not a major issue.

Hands down it's the best meal I have eaten on-board a flight. While I am at it, I might add that they can be bit generous with serving portions. IFE is bit boring and it needs more variety and latest movies. All this on one side and their cabin crew on another side. They elevate the experience on to another level. Vistara's crew are very professional and warm-hearted people. I could see that they are eager to help and nothing was trouble at all. Crew on DEL-FRA sector were the best crew I have experienced in my years of travel. They take individual orders from premium eco cabin and nothing comes from trolley.

The extra legroom seats were very comfortable and it was also a pleasant surprise to know that the airline have also started resuming their inflight meal services which consisted of a veg sandwich, cookies and a bottle of water. There was also the inflight entertainment Vistara World which was accessible from the devices but I didn't go through it in detail although it seemed it had a decent collection of bollywood / hollywood movies. Arrival was ahead of schedule and baggage retrieval was also very smooth. Overall I have to say that this was an excellent flight service for such a short journey, I can only imagine how much better flying on premium economy / business would be.

22526,Vueling Airlines,1.0,"""my family and I felt taken advantage of",2023-07-01,True," Unpleasant Experience with Vueling Airlines: Excessive and Unreasonable Baggage Charges and rude staff. Recent trip from Paris to La Coruña, Spain, the experience was far from the quality service one would expect from a prominent airline operating from one of the world's top tourist destinations. Upon arrival at the airport in Paris, I encountered an agent at the counter who seemed to lack proficiency in English or Spanish. Given Paris's global appeal, I was taken aback by the language barrier, which made communication and problem-solving unnecessarily difficult. My family and I (a group of 6) had already paid for three extra suitcases. Additionally, we had three carry-on bags that conformed to your airline's size specifications. However, the counter agent insisted we had to pay extra for each carry-on to take them onboard. The lack of effective communication compounded the frustration of this unexpected charge. Even when faced with the inconvenience of either losing what we had already paid for tickets or allowing our vacation to be marred, we chose to accommodate your airlines' demands. Thus, we agreed to pay an additional $150, albeit begrudgingly. However, to our utter surprise, we were informed the charges were actually double - $300 - due to a short layover in Barcelona. This seemed illogical and unfair as our final destination was La Coruña, and the stopover was not of our choosing. More so, our bags were to be checked directly to our final destination. Our attempts to discuss this discrepancy were ignored, leaving us no choice but to yield to these unjust charges. To further compound our disappointment, the carry-ons, for which we paid $300, were not allowed on the cabin with us but were handled as checked luggage. These bags contained valuable items not intended for stowage in the cargo hold and lacked the necessary locks for such handling. In summary, my family and I felt taken advantage of and robbed of an additional $300. Our journey was tainted by unwarranted stress and unjustified costs. We were left feeling helpless, with our only recourse being to write this review in hopes it may prevent future travelers from encountering similar or worse experiences. I urge Vueling Airlines to address these issues promptly and reconsider their approach to customer service, particularly communication and transparency regarding their policies.",A321,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Paris Orly to La Coruña via Barcelona,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,June,2023

Of all the LCCs I have flown with I would say that they are probably the best. The neo was clean and very quiet and the on-board service was excellent. This was also the first time that our son had flown and the Captain presented him with a signed certificate to mark his first flight. This was a lovely touch and was very special indeed. I liked the fact that Vueling are using BA gates at LGW and consequently the aircraft was much closer to the security area. The aircraft also used an air bridge at both ends of the journey (rare for a low cost carrier) and the cabin was equipped with individual air vents (not always seen on new aircraft nowadays). Wi-Fi (although not free) was fast and reliable. My only observation was that the food menu could have been larger. That said, we were really impressed. Highly recommended.

The attitude of the cabin crew was not acceptable: 1st: they said to us that we had the info about the catering before the flight (we did no have it). 2nd: The cabin crew and the senior cabin crew were eating their meals in front of us in the galley and laughing, during this time and we had nothing to eat. 3rd: the cabin crew at the front had a friend in the flight and thy were talking every time with him loudly and laughing in the galley. This is not a good professional attitude. Moreover, the cabin crew at the back had an aggressive way to talk with passengers, he seemed bored to be here. Shame on him. Never again with Vueling for us. We like to go often to Canaria, and to Europe but we'll never take this company. We’ll take a real company with an experienced and trained crew, not this Vueling bus without crew in the cabin.

I paid £795 for 2 adults and a child to fly one-way from Rome to Gatwick. This is a lot of money for such a terrible service.  We paid extra for row 3 ""More space plus"" - this includes extra luggage allowance in the overhead bin & priority boarding. The priority boarding just didn't happen. As a result, we boarded about halfway through the process, and as we joined, every single overhead locker was full until row 10. However, on closer inspection, around 1/3 of these bags did not have yellow ""approved"" overhead locker tags on them, they were just the bags that should be stowed under the seat, but lazy passengers had just stored them in the bins. There was no monitoring or policing of the bin policy by any of the cabin crew, so this led to huge amounts of aggravation from all the passengers (like me) who had paid £30 extra for overhead luggage storage but now could not access it. The cabin crew were lazy, rude and surly.  The 4 cabin crew ""hid"" behind their curtain at the front of the plane for the majority of the flight, laughing and giggling and ignored their customers for at least 75% of the journey. When passengers tried to access the front of the plane, the cabin crew held the curtain closed so the passengers couldn't get in. The food and beverage service started 25 minutes after the seatbelt lights had gone off.  I was in Row 3, the crisps/snacks had already run out before they even got to me. The crew stopped people from using the front toilet (even when the light was green and the toilet was unoccupied), sending them to the back of the plane.  It was truly amazingly bad customer service.

22934,Xiamen Airlines,8.0,"""at a very cheap price""",2018-12-03,True,"  Singapore to Vancouver via Xiamen. Note that my rating here is for XMN-YVR, not considering SIN-XMN, and not taking into account the visa issues at XMN. If you are not a holder of one of the 53 countries' passports that qualify for visa exemption by the Chinese government, then you need to apply for a visa before flying. XMN does not offer visa services at the airport. The main reason for the need of a visa is, XMN does not have a usual transit arrangement, which usually doesn't require you to go through immigration. At XMN, in order to transit, you have to go through immigration, which means you are entering China and then leaving China officially, just to transit between flights. This is why people transiting with passports that do not qualify for visa exemption have to apply for visa. If you are unsure, please make sure you email your local Xiamen Air representatives to check. Regarding SIN-XMN, it was below average. It was an older aircraft, without individual IFE system. The stewardesses were willing to help and respond to demands, but they were typically brisk and curt with their responses. Food was okay, not remarkable. XMN-YVR was excellent. The economy seat was comfortable, and leg room was good. Food was excellent and more than sufficient. In fact, the stewardesses made rounds between meals to ask if people wanted snacks, like bread rolls, sandwiches, or peanuts. The stewardesses were very friendly and approachable, very willing to help the passengers. It is unfortunate that their command of the English language is below average, but if you speak Mandarin, then you are fine. All in, it was an excellent flight at a very cheap price. I think, if you are travelling on Xiamen Air's Boeing 787, then there is a good chance that your flight will be a very good one. But if you are travelling on Xiamen Air's older aircraft, then you may not get to experience the better side of the airline. Finally, there is no online check-in services for international flights for Xiamen Air. You can choose your seats only if you spend some money.

Very Chinese cuisines on all 4 legs of the flight (2 international, 2 domestic). Just remember, the airline is Chinese and therefore will serve Chinese food - don't expect Panda Express type food like the US. The food is primarily pork based with some fish, chicken or beef offering. If you elect vegetarian or muslim or any other special needs food, make sure you request this 24 hours before your flight. I saw some western folks unhappy with seeing unfamiliar Chinese food being served on a Chinese airline - I had to chuckle watching them eat the bread and desert for their meals. The only issue which is not the airline's fault was going thru Chinese immigration. We did not have a Chinese visa which is normally required for landing in China, but 50+ countries can ""transit"" thru China if you can prove your final destination is outside of China. The government issues a temporary transit visa for those that are going thru the country - it's good for 24 hours. At our 2 hr layover for refueling, Qingdao was the worst - they scrutinized and held up the entire non Chinese group of passengers looking for errors & past problems. They pulled 2 passengers out of the group for failing to register with a local Chinese police agency the last time they were in China. Military uniformed people surrounded them making you feel like you are in a communist country.... The airline staff was very good at preparing you for Chinese immigration - having your itinerary with you, boarding pass with correct name spelled, etc. Landing at Xiamen was much easier and nicer immigration folks. We even had time to visit the First class airport lounge using our Amex Plat card. Return trip was good and we even had an overnight layover and the airline provided a hotel for the night at no cost which was nice. We did have to pay the taxi rides both ways so remember to bring some Chinese Yuan (RMB) currency. We got to also go on a tour of the city on a double decker sightseeing bus that took us all around the perimeter of the island. Overall, a very nice new and fresh airline to fly with for many Asian countries.",Boeing 787-9,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Seoul via Xiamen,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,yes,May,2018
22958,Xiamen Airlines,7.0,"""English skill needs improvement""",2017-07-14,False,"  Los Angeles to Xiamen. The flight was delayed due to unknown reason.  The aircraft is relatively new, bright, clean and modern. The interior was specially decorated for this inauguration flight with LAX symbols. The crews welcomed us with big smiles and everyone gets a little gift for the inauguration flight. They personal entertainment system has a large screen, and the system worked just as I wanted without struggle. A safety card, two magazines and a menu in the pocket; a blanket and a bottle of water on the seat. But the menu missed a translation for breakfast. The food is not bad but can be improved. The crew were trying to act as friendly, but lacked some sincereness, but they did a great job. Their English skill really needs improvement.  As a Chinese airline they followed the CAAC rule, which restricted people to use their laptops and other devices only when the aircraft reached cruising attitude and didn't allow passengers to switch on their phones at all. And they locked the 787 windows to a certain brightness which make them impossible to adjust by passengers. Another problem is that I had a transfer flight at XMN, but I had to pick up my luggage and recheck it again.

The airline lured us into boarding and we were kept on the aircraft for over an hour without any announcements, which is shameful.

Remember this is not low cost airline, but they provide very low quality of service, no individual display on each deck, phone must switch off even after seatbelt sign switch-off, no entertaintment for 5 hours on my last trip, only served drink for once, strongly not recommended to take this airline if situation is allowed.",Boeing 737-800,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Xiamen,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,January,2017
22977,Xiamen Airlines,3.0,"""ridiculous airport procedures in Xiamen""",2016-06-30,False," Amsterdam to Bangkok via Xiamen with Xiamen Airlines. This airline is ridiculous and so are the airport procedures in Xiamen. Me and my boyfriend had booked a flight from Amsterdam to Bangkok via Xiamen for an insanely good price of €370. Xiamen does not allow online check in for international flights. At the baggage drop in AMS, we asked whether the luggage could be tagged to our final destination. No proper answer could be given. Finally, at the gate we were told to pick up our luggage in Xiamen and drop it off again there. The flight itself was pretty good, except for the food which had no taste at all. Horrible. This airline does not allow any mobile phones to be turned on. Not even when they are on airplane mode. They need to be switched off, and if they find out you secretly use your phone the crew will stand next to you until you switch it off. WiFi may be used on iPads and Notebooks only. After a few hours the crew handed out arrivals / departure cards and you will need them. The crew will tell you that you won't need them for transiting however, you do need them. You will be put back in line at immigration if you don't have them filled out. Every single person has to go through immigration, even when your next flight is in 30 minutes or so. The horror really started when arriving in Xiamen. The procedure is as follows: Get out of the airplane. Walk towards customs via declare or not declare route. Go through immigration (with arrivals / departure card, passport, eticket) and you will get a temporary entrance permission. Go to baggage belt and get your luggage. Put your luggage through x-ray. Take elevator one level up. Now it gets tricky. If you have a 6 hours or more transit. Proceed to (transfer service) counter B11 for a FREE hotel. You do need to pay for travel costs. The hotel was good, but checking in took 45-60 minutes, they are so slow and don't understand English. After that return to the airport to the departures floor. Proceed to Intl. departures. Put your luggage through x-ray. Now you will find the check in counters, check in your flights and luggage. Walk upstairs and go through immigration (hand over your departures card and passport). Go through hand luggage check (they have very strict rules for power banks). If the power bank itself doesn't show its capacity it will be thrown away. No argument possible. Now proceed to the gate to your airplane that will bring you to your next destination. Never I will fly with Xiamen Airlines again. It is cheap, but that's probably all positive about it (and the free transit hotel).",Boeing 787,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,AMS to BKK via XMN,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,no,June,2016

23024,XL Airways France,1.0,"""really a great experience""",2017-07-31,False,"  San Francisco to Paris. I was a bit nervous using this airline. I did a ton of research and looked for reviews and couldn't really find reviews base off the experience of their airline. Some of these reviews for XL I feel are from people that expected too much for a budget airline. I read the instructions and recommendations from their website, which I would read entirely to help you have a better experience. When I arrived at the airport I had my boarding pass printed before hand and was quickly greeted by an XL employee. They checked my passport and they checked the weight and size of my luggage. I had to check my luggage in the system, because the weight was too high. Upon boarding I was greeted by a very professional and flight attendants who spoke English and French. They realized I didn't speak French and directed me to my seat. Upon departing they did the standard procedures in French and English for departure. During the flight they provided a blanket, earplugs, water and a free meal! This is a very French airline and the food was very French and flavorful. They were very accommodating for refills of water, tea, and coffee that were free. The airplane itself is older so there is no WIFI onboard for internet. I was not disappointed, because they did provide a free movie and I also had my IPad. I would recommend you take a portable charger for your phone, tablet, or laptop. There are not electrical plugs on the seats for your electronic devices. Throughout the trip the flight attendants were on point and made sure the restrooms were cleaned and that passengers were comfortable. Considering the price I paid for the ticket this is a great value! This is a budget airline and for the overall package this was really a great experience.",A330,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Paris,3.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,yes,July,2017

The aircraft from Los Angeles to Paris was clean, the attendants were very involved throughout the 10 hour flight (and were pleasant as well), and the flight itself was smooth. Yes the seats are crammed in there and the entertainment is not great. There is wifi and you can watch movies on your iPad. (They also rent ipad minis for $20 so bring your own!). I read a little and tried to sleep so this wasn't a deal breaker for me given the reasonable fare. If want more leg room, you pay dearly ($70 extra) but this is worth it for me. We left and arrived on time which adds a star. I actually found it a much more pleasant experience than my super expensive Air France flight last year.

23125,ZIPAIR,8.0,"""I’d highly recommend ZIPAIR""",2023-06-14,False,"  A small bottle of water is $2. Cup of coffee $4. It is certainly easy enough to bring snacks/food from home, or pick something up from the airport, just be forewarned.  You will pay $50-$80 for any checked bags, up to three. They did not check the weight of my carry-on on the way to Japan, but did for the return flight. And as one of my checked bags was overweight, I had to re-distribute from on to another there at the check-in counter, but that was fine and the agent helped me so I didn’t have to pay for an additional suitcase. The seat was very comfortable, but you’re only able to partially recline it. There is no video screen, no in-flight entertainment, and the only Wi-Fi we were able to access went directly to their service site where you could order food and drinks. This is no frills but the airfare was $800 less than any other carrier. So even with a connecting flight on Southwest, and staying overnight in a hotel near the airport in San Jose (Hyatt Place, highly recommended) I still came out $500 under any other fare. The days when “getting there is half the fun” are long gone. But if you want a bargain flight price with nice attendants, excellent baggage handling, excellent crew, I’d highly recommend ZIPAIR.",Boeing 787-8,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Jose to Tokyo,5.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,yes,May,2023
23136,ZIPAIR,9.0,"""would definitely fly with again""",2023-04-28,True," Very impressed. These seats are marketed as Business Class 'Lite' i.e.. you are getting a flat bed seat but not much else for the ticket price. However, I would actually rate the experience with Zip on this flight from Tokyo to Singapore more highly than my experiences with other airlines such as British Airways, who constantly disappoint. The value for money is way better that's for sure. As is the customer service. In summary: Check in process could have been better. Had to wait in queue for about half an hour. I think all passengers are required to manually check in at a desk for this flight. Or at least we were on this occasion. No fast track for business class. On the flight itself, the seats were very comfortable. The blanket provided was especially nice. As were the slippers. The restrooms were very clean and the toiletries provided were ample. Things like mouthwash, hand cream, etc. The staff were excellent. Polite, attentive, courteous. The food was good for what it was. I had spicy chicken with rice. It was basically a microwave meal but still tasty. The fruit was fresh and flavoursome. Free Wi-Fi for business class. Although this is a given on most premium seats, there are still airlines who cash in on charging for Wi-Fi (British Airways for example), so its nice that Zip provide it for free. I would definitely fly with Zip again.",Boeing 787,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Tokyo to Singapore,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,yes,April,2023
23152,ZIPAIR,9.0,"""I highly recommend ZipAir""",2022-11-11,True,"  It was my first time with ZipAir and I was a bit leery of flying so far with a budget airline, but it was an enjoyable experience. Off to a good start, the check-in was fast and efficient. I flew in Standard (economy) class with 3-3-3 seating, which was comfortable with adequate legroom. The basic fare is only for the seat, but I opted for the ""value"" package to get 23 kg checked baggage, seat selection plus a meal (pre-selected from a picture menu) and still saved about $500 over the fares of established airlines. Passengers are required to show their boarding pass during flight to verify the optional upgrade. The tasty meal came in a box on a tray, with just beef and rice next to bottled water. There was no salad, dessert nor other drink, But the free Wi-Fi connected to my smart phone allowed ordering drinks and snacks later, as well as compensating for having no seatback screen. The charming cabin attendants were very safety conscious, double-checking to make sure overhead bins were closed securely. ZipAir should be commended for creating a unique budget flying experience on lengthy international flights. Some earlier negative Skytrax reviews were based on unmet pandemic regulations and refund policies, not the flights themselves, Overall, I highly recommend ZipAir as an alternative to traditional carriers whose fares have skyrocketed on the HNL-NRT route since the pandemic, Just follow the their common sense rules and enjoy the money saved.",Boeing 787,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Honolulu to Tokyo Narita,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,yes,November,2022
23169,ZIPAIR,6.0,"""It was immaculately clean""",2022-05-23,True," Zipair is JAL’s budget airline. They don’t have classes of travel, you just pick your seat (flat bed, emergency exit etc) and pay accordingly. We usually travel BA or JAL business class. This trip was last minute and JAL business was going to cost $8k. Instead we paid just over $2.5k to fly with Zipair in their fully flat seats. Your ticket includes nothing but 7kg of cabin baggage (and they do weigh rucksacks/handbags etc), a bottle of water and the seat you booked. Check in process was not good. Of course we aren’t used to queuing for check in, but here everyone queues. There is no Advanced Passenger Information loaded, so with covid added the check in process was long. Also both our cabin bags were over 7kg so we had to put a bag in the hold. (You can pay to add a bag to the hold, but you can’t pay for additional cabin baggage. They are strict on weight to the gram). We were also asked if we had a return ticket, which as it was booked at the same time as the outward trip was a bit worrying. Finally because the seat map is misleading we had not booked seats together (eg row 2 does not align across the cabin so although we had seats that were both in row 2, in fact I was sat behind and to the right of my husband. This was pointed out to us at check-in but we weren’t allowed to change our seats despite the fact that there were only 2 other seats taken in the fully flat cabin. Seats must be booked at least 24 hours before check-in and again this is enforced strictly. (We couldn’t even change seats on board although the seat on my husband’s left was free). The fully flat bed was nearly as good as JAL/BA business class (not quite so much storage). Includes reading light, table and some storage space. You can stow your hand baggage under the foot stool for take-off and landing (an improvement on the new BA business class seats). Its quite hard, but otherwise good. It was immaculately clean (again better than BA), cabin crew were excellent and it felt safe. There is no entertainment screen. WiFi is included free of charge, and a (very) small selection of films is available. The fully flat seat has a USB charging point. Fairly basic food and drinks can be bought on board by ordering via your mobile device and QI code. The onboard shop opens about an hour after take-off and closes about an hour before landing. Otherwise meals must be booked in advance. Pre-booked meals are served before the onboard shop is open, so you can’t buy a drink until after your meal. Cushions and blankets are not included, but can be bought from the online shop. In deciding whether to use Zipair you need to compare cost to convenience. If you have time to download movies, book seats in advance (there is no app to make this easy), pre-order meals, and to bring your own pre- and with-meal drinks that will help. Also to bring your own cushion/blanket if you like to sleep as soon as you get on board. For me, some of the joy was missing. There wasn’t enough meal/entertainment/shopping to pass much time for those who are not good at sleeping. Is that worth $5.5k - only you can answer that.",Dreamliner,Business,Business Class,Tokyo to Los Angeles,3.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,yes,May,2022
